**Edit**

Since this post blew up, and made its way on over to the /r/All sub-Reddit and most of them don't understand what is going on, I decided to make an edit with a video that pretty much sums up all of the bad actors and more mentioned in this post, so if you want a backstory, just watch this video from /u/dougpolkpoker for a better understanding: https://youtu.be/upPmNzcqFkU",2018-01-18 03:46:08

While I have your attention, I want to take 5 seconds of your time and bring some exposure to something that is threatening our existence as the human race. If you aren't interested, please skip down to the main article. I'm talking about finding a way to live sustainably on this planet, regenerative agriculture, where we get our food from, and how we can make sure that our kids and grandkids have something left once we leave. 

Please consider reading up on Permaculture, sustainable living, Forest gardening, Backyard Chickens, etc. Consider following what I did and do it for yourself. [This all used to be a useless lawn.](https://youtu.be/U79bql-JSqI)

[Bored for a night? Go watch ""Sustainable"" on Netflix.](https://sustainablefoodfilm.com/) 

Look into people like [Geoff Lawton](http://www.geofflawtononline.com/), Mark Shepard, Sepp Holzer, these people are going to save us. 

Want to make a small change yourself? Grow a tomato plant on your balcony in a pot. Reduce transport of the tomatoes you eat, and make ~$50 per plant in saved money. Want to do something bigger? Plant a fruit tree in your backyard. Maybe two. Maybe a raspberry bush. You are now part of saving the human race.

If everyone reading this planted a fruit tree, or even some wild flowers, we could save the bees.

While you are at it, planting a fruit tree has been shown to be one of the best investments on the planet. There's pretty much no investment on the planet that is more financially lucrative (while still being nearly bullet-proof safe) than planting a fruit tree.

You can get a tree at an end of sale auction for literally 5-10 bucks, and that tree will produce THOUSANDS of dollars of fruit for you in it's lifetime. Go spend $200 bucks at an end of season sale, plant 10-20 trees (if you have room), and that $200 will be worth tens of thousands of dollars of saved money.

Do it right, [set it up right and it's almost no work](https://youtu.be/bjBLVSo0zeY) because you offload the work to nature - as it has done for the last few billion years. Go learn how, let me show you how. If you do it right, it's zero work after you have planted and wood-chipped, and all you do is pull dollars off a tree.

Original post starts below. I apologize for the shilling of Permaculture, but I think loss of topsoil will impact us all if we don't reverse it soon. We need soil, we need bees, we need food. We need to stop buying December Bananas in Canada. We need to start supporting local permaculture sustainable farms. We need to do this or we may not make it, and our grandkids stand no chance.

**I also expended the ""now what happens"" section, to explain how these pullbacks are a good thing, make crypto more stable, and why we keep seeing larger ceilings after every pullback... this stuff is really important for you to make money on this thing, if that's your goal....**

I've made a similar post in a few spots, and this is something that is absolutely critical for people to understand... what impacts price, and what is going on lately. Price has only a very minor correlation with money invested, and a major correlation with opinion. 

... and Humans are an emotional bunch.

So what drives price of any commodity, crypto, gold, pizzas, whatever? The money invested in it, right? Kind of, but not really. What if I told you that you could theoretically raise bitcoin from $15k to $20k by spending $1, and lower it from $25k to $1k by spending the same $1? Crazy right?

**AN EXAMPLE**

This is going to start out slow, I want to make sure I get everyone on the same page before I pick things up and lift the curtain. Stick with me here....

This is an example to help illustrate why prices aren't driven by money invested, but rather consensus and opinion. Lets imagine the following exists (we will use bitcoin as an example, but this is how everything on the planet works)

Lets say Bitcoin is currently priced at $10k (the last sale). From $11k to $99k, every $1k there is someone with a sell order of 1 full bitcoin. From $9k to $1 dollar, every $1k on the way down there is someone with a buy order of 1 full bitcoin.

So, right now if you wanted to buy bitcoin you have several options... meet the lowest seller's price of $11k, or, put your own buy order up, above the highest buyer's bid order (overcut them). If you decide to just place an order, the price doesn't change. If you decide the buy the $11k bitcoin, now bitcoins value is $11k, with a new lowest sell offer of $12k, and a highest buy bid of $10k. Someone else comes in an overcuts the buy bid and puts 1 BTC for sale for $11k. No trades are made until someone matches a buy/sell.

Okay, that's kindergarten stuff, most people here understand that. So how much money drove the price up in this situation? $11k, and BTC price raised 11/10, 1.10, or 10% from the last sale. Now the entire marketcap of BTC raised 10% (last sale multiplied by circulating supply). So it takes $11k to drive a 10% increase, right? Not at all. Lets look at what happens when news is released.

News comes out that Warren Buffet thinks bitcoin is a scam, a bubble, and he wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because he only invests in things he understands and he doesn't understand crypto. People panic everywhere, and believe ""this guy is smart, I'm overvaluing this thing"".

Suddenly people don't want to buy this scam anymore, and the buy orders for $11k, $10, and $9k are taken down. 

At the same time, the people wanting to sell start to panic and just want out. The guy at $32k (who just had that offer up ""just incase it moons"") drops down to $11k sell order. The guy at $12k, who was the lowest, now undercuts him to $10k. 

The other buyers see the sellers undercutting and think that if these people want out, why am I buying in. The $8k guy pulls his offer, and so do the $7k, $6k and $5k guys. The highest offer is now $4k. 

The sellers panic further and the $14k guy undercuts the $10k guy and puts up a $9k sell. The $15k, 17k and 11k guys all see this flurry of panic and now a storm undercutting is triggered, to $8k, $7k, and $6k. The $8k order pulls his again and goes down to $5k. 

The price on the buy and sell orders has moved around a ton, but no sales have actually happened yet. Technically, BTC is still ""worth"" $11k, and the market cap reflects that. All this horseshit has happened, and it only happened in 10 seconds, but the price hasn't moved yet. 

The $27k guy wakes up and checks his phone. He had a $27k offer just incase the price moved also, and he also only has a tiny infinitesimal fraction of a BTC. Well, he decides ""he's out"" and fills $1 worth of the part of the $4k guys buy offer.

The latest price information is now updated, and BTC fell from $11k to $4k price per BTC with the movement of a single dollar.

This is exaggerated example, but this is what moves price. Not money in vs money out. The ONLY THING that moves price is perception.

**OPINION FLOW AND NOT MONEY FLOW**

Now the above example only happens if everyone simultaneously believe the same thing... this the asset they are holding is a steaming turd. What happens in reality is there's no black and white, it's shades of gray. It's flow in vs flow out. But again, not flow MONEY, but rather OPINIONS.

If 66% of the holders of something all of a sudden unanimously decide that their asset is overvalued, then they panic sell. Even if 33% of the people decide they are going to buy up as much as these panic sellers sell, if the panic is strong enough, and they are slitting eachother's throat to sell, then the buyers just happily sit and let them do that, and time their buys in. Very little money has to actually change hands in order for this price to crash, all that matters is the FLOW OF OPINION has to be swift and violent, and in majority. The sellers will leapfrog eachother on the way down, faster than the buyers scoop up their sales, and the net result is a crashed price.

Note, this happens both ways... fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) as well as overhyped FOMO (Fear of missing out). 

**So now what happens?**

Time goes by and all holders opinions of their asset hasn't changed. They still think it's worth $11k and they got great deals scooping up what these sellers were selling. The weak hands have left the market and have been replaced with holders. Overall, now a higher percentage of holders believe in the product they are holding and are unwilling to sell for the panic prices of the last week. Panic sellers were also replaced by new money, people who have wanted in for a while and are now in on their perceived ground floor.

Also, people who bought BTC at $1 ten years ago and have been looking for an exit to cash profits have now been replaced by either long term holders, or by these new people who are thrilled to have finally entered, and they are looking to hold long. 

So what happens on pullbacks? The number of people waiting to jump off the ship has decreased. The new ground floor is established. Are we done? Who knows, this could go on for another year, but what matters is that people who want off are getting off and people that want on are getting on. 

People who have panic sold and never believed in this in the firstplace... people who have wanted out for 10 years... they have been replaced by people who are now getting in on THEIR GROUND FLOOR, and are going to be holding long. The market is suddenly increasingly more stable today than it was yesterday, even though prices are down. 

**This is a good thing.** This is why crypto keeps bouncing back from pullbacks and reaches new higher ceilings and floors each time. Old money who wanted out, and new panic holders, they are gone. They are replaced with adopters, holders, believers in this technology. These people aren't selling anytime soon, because they believe that this thing is going to revolutionize the world. Every crash brings more of these people in, and removes more panic sellers out. 

**Moving forward**

Now news releases start coming out about how stock ETFs are being created, NASDAQ index funds, bank support, government support. Companies are using this tech, and companies who use blockchain for transportation are putting non-blockchain companies out of business. 

The people on the outside looking-in feel they are missing out. They now start coming in and buying. They start overpricing eachother on their buy orders, and eventually it gets close enough to a sell order that someone decides they are just going to meet the sell price. The sale goes through.

Sellers (HODLERs) see this action, and they start pulling sell orders off the table almost as fast as they fill. Sure some trades go through, and incoming money is driving the price up as market orders are filled. But what's also happening is people are seeing this flurry of volume, and sellers are pulling sell orders and placing them higher. 

Junk coins and pump and dump scam coins are dying by the millions. In their ashes, good solid technology projects whose coins have fundamental economic reasons for growth, these are rising. Corporate partnerships continue forming. The real world continues to create actual use cases. Companies start storing more and more corporate information on blockchain. Public companies use blockchain to store scientific research (See Canadian Research Council announcements), and blockchain acts as a Library of Alexandria. People can travel out of country without any monetary exchange, using their chosen cryptocurrency to buy the things they need abroad. The world is slowly actually USING this technology. 

Money is coming in, but more importantly, OPINION IS CHANGING. Literally nothing could have happened in terms of fundamentals, partnerships, etc... this can all be driven entirely emotional, so long as it's wide-spread and strong. Infact, the market could THEORETICALLY rebound in this way from $4000/BTC to $1 MILLION PER BITCOIN by the sale of ONE PENNY. $4000 sound low? Does that number make you uncomfortable? We may go that low. We may not. If we do, I'm not panicking and selling, I'm buying more.


**SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS? and where are we going?**

A lot of new money has come in from Nov-Jan, and they don't really know what they are investing in. Sure some of them have done great research and are smart investors but most people aren't and isntead they are buying Symbols and Names and trading on speculation. They are treating their favorite coins like a sports team, and will follow them irrationally off a cliff.

These new people came in and invested in cryptocurrency because their OPINION was heavily influenced in Nov, Dec, Jan, from media. They saw this money making machine called crypto. They were willing to pay huge, ride the wave up, keep buying, etc. They were ""ground floor adopters"" and were going to get rich.

They outnumber the old money by A LOT. Their OPINION MATTERS. It matters the most.

To keep this in perspective, they are also a VAST MINORITY of ""new money"" that will enter the game in the next decade. This cycle will continue over and over and over. 

Their opinion rose nearly unbounded and price rose accordingly. Market cap rose from 10B to 750B, and it could have been VERY LITTLE actual money that did this. How much did it need to be though? Literally ONE PENNY, theoretically. All that matters in moving price is MOMENTUM OF OPINION. I believe it has been estimated that as low as 6B USD was responsible for the bull rush.

These people then started hearing ""Bubble"", ""Scam"", Fake news about governments banning. They don't understand how technology wins, always. Crypto is beyond government control. If they could have stopped Bitcoin they would have done it already. 

**WHO IS DRIVING ALL THIS?**

Most investment opportunities go first to ""accredited investors"". You need to have multimillions in order to get in on the ground floor for most stock IPOs, and we're seeing that start to happen with coin ICOs. Bitcoin was a joke for the first few years, while lunatics picked it up. At this point, it was really too late to get in ""early"", and who would have wanted to anyways, it was all still a joke. So Wallstreet, banks, governments have generally watched on the sidelines as average Joes who were crazy enough to be early adopters and toss $100 on fake internet money slowly became millionaires. 

Not only that, but the idea of blockchain started to become understood. The power and value in it became understood. Not only as a way to track ""monetary value"" but for many other applications as well. Platforms were created, business uses brainstormed, products started being made. This thing started taking off, and wasn't a joke anymore. But regardless, big money wasn't in on the ground floor. They have stakeholders opinions to think of, and what do they say to investors when they lose all their money on magic internet points?

But they have woken up now. This thing has ""popped"" many times now and keeps recovering. This thing won't die. could they have been wrong all along? If they want in, how do they get in? They are no dummies, they have been controlling the world their whole lives? Look at the media experiment that Trump is doing? He is testing just how we work... you can do literally anything and we remember it for like 30 seconds, until the next news story comes out. We change opinions very easily. We are swayed very easily. We are their puppets. Media controls the world. They know their way in.

They have ONE WEAPON against cryptocurrency.

YOUR OPINION OF IT.

And they know it.

**Media.**

That's why FUD is so powerful and needs to be respected. It's why we need to read more than titles on news articles. We need to question what we read, **whether it's good news or bad news**. We need to think about ""what are the motives of the person saying this to me"". Does the government have a conflict of interest when they state that crypto is gambling? Do they have skin in the game? 

What about wall street? Does WEISS ratings possibly have incentive to come out with poor ratings? Do banks have incentive to lock accounts in order to ""protect"" customers from ""unsafe investments"" when their entire business model revolves around holding as much of your money as possible and making money off it? Do you think banks have any super secret hidden interest in preventing you from storing your money elsewhere? I'm not sure, maybe you can critically think about that.

Just understand that this goes both ways. When crypto is booming and Fox news is showing people how to buy $4 ripple on prime time, you may want to start putting in some stop loss orders. When the suicide hotline is stickied at the top of /r/cryptocurrency and everyone is panic selling, you may want to start picking up some firesale deals. 

So, the question is this... Is crypto undervalued or overvalued at it's price today? Where is the price going long term? **I'm not talking about it's use case**, I'm talking about in the **court of public opinion**, where is THAT going? Because THAT is what is going to drive price in the future.

Without a crystal ball, this is of course impossible to know. Do your own research and form your own opinion. It could very well be that the technology having a use-case will in and of itself drive opinion, and thus price. But make sure you understand that it's not the technology itself, it's not the value of the business itself, it's not the use case itself that will drive price, it is the publics OPINION of that thing which drives price. They are intertwined, but they are NOT the same thing.

TLDR: VERY VERY little money has to move around in order to swing prices drastically, up or down. Money in and out doesn't drive price, OPINION does. How do you let the news you read impact your opinion?How are you being played (on both sides, shilling and FUD).

Something is only worth what people think it's worth. Often that's based on reality, value, business, money, but often it's entirely emotional.

[Structure your portfolio in a balance, intelligent way, using risk methodology.](https://www.investinblockchain.com/cryptocurrency-investment-risk-management/). Invest money you are willing to lose. Support legitimate technology and teams who are actively driving their product to completion, coding, and marketing. Stop trying to make money overnight in pump and dump scams, or pyramid schemes. 

Every day, take one coin, do a deep dive on it, learn it inside and out. Look into their team and their past. Do that every day for a year, and you just learned 365 coins inside and out. Ask yourself the following key questions:

Have those members consistently jumped ship on previous projects? Is that where you want to invest in? Is their team capable of executing on their vision? Are they trying to solve world hunger, and their team is a few 16 year olds in a garage? How active is their github? Are they adding chunks of code regularly, or is a ghost town? Are they marketing their product at all? Or is marketing the only thing they are doing? 

What are the economics of their coin itself? Is it required to be used to gain access to their technology? Are there burns? How premined is it, and what portion do the founders hold? 

What about their vision? Are they trying to solve a problem that needs to be solved? What are the economics of that problem and how much money does the solution potentially save clients?

These are all questions you should be asking when you give your money to someone else. We're a lot more stable than we were - a correction was bound to happen. Too much early money wanted to cash in profits. These people have been replaced by new money who is holding on their own ground floor. The whole industry in general is still in very early stages. Rest assured that anyone reading this is still very much an early adopter. Just make sure you are investing in actual technology, and supporting capable teams, and not buying air. Buy the Googles and Amazons of Crypto, not the pets.com or flooz.com of cryptos.

Happy investing everyone.

We've seen a peak bubble at around 850 billion total market cap in the first week of January, consolidated down to $750 billion and have now just experienced a 40% correction. 

#What's happening now and how bad will it get?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all you should realize that there is a [January Dip that happens every year, when we see a roughly 20-30% decline around mid January](https://i.imgur.com/VXEHw0W.png). This year its been much more severe though for several additional factors that have compounded on top.

Different theories exist on why this happens (its actually the mirror opposite of the ""January Effect"" that happens in the US stock market), but the two major theories are:

1) Asian markets pull into fiat because of Asian New Year spending needs

2) People in the US sell in January to defer their capital gains tax liability an extra year

While this cyclic event has lead to a healthy correction in the last few years, this year we got these new factors making more fear as well:

* [Yet more scary news on China cracking down on crypto exchanges](http://www.coindesk.com/pboc-official-calls-for-wider-ban-on-chinese-crypto-trading-report/)

* [Korea regulatory uncertainty](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/cryptocurrencies-resume-slide-as-bitcoin-tumbles-to-december-low)

* [European governments talking about regulations](http://news.yahoo.com/rule-bitcoin-must-global-germanys-central-bank-says-154144224--business.html)

* [BTC futures contracts are now expiring this week](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_settlements_futures.html), and possible manipulation there with contract hedging pushing the price down

* Bitconnect Ponzi finally collapses

* We had a new breed of speculators come in during the November/December timeframe after media made cryptocurrency mainstream following the Bitcoin 10K landmark. While cryptocurrency markets have always had too much hype, the latest rise wasn't just over-enthusiasm in fundamentally sound cryptocurrencies like Monero and Ethereum, but mass inflows of fiat into vaporware and complete nonsense without any use case. Many people came in to essentially gamble on symbols on an exchange, and are thus short term oriented and quick to sell on any slight downturn, which such further adds to selling pressure.

So in essence we got a storm of scary news along with the usual cyclic downturn. Currently I don't see this as being a systematic crash like Mt.Gox was that would lead to a long term bear market because the fundamental ecosystem is still intact, and I suspect that after about a month we should consolidate around a new low. All the exchanges are still operational and liquid, and there is no breakdown in trust nor uncertainty whether you'll be able to cash out. What range the market trades in will all depend how Bitcoin does, right now we've already broken below 10K but I'm seeing a lot of support at around $8000, which is [roughly where the long term MA curve settles](https://i.imgur.com/kKVsoUt.png). We don't know how bad it will get or what the future will bring, but as of right now we shouldn't be in a bear market yet.

**What should you do if you recently entered the market?**

If you did buy in the last few months at or near ATH, the very worst thing you can do now is sell in panic and lose your principal. You shouldn't have more money in crypto than you can afford to lose, so it shouldn't be a problem to wait. You have to realize that 30% corrections in crypto are relatively common, just last fall we had a 40% flash correction over more China fears. Unless there is a systematic breakdown like we had during Mt.Gox, the market always recovers. 

The other worst thing you can do is unload into Tether as your safety net. If there is one thing that could actually cause a long term destruction of trust within the cryptocurrency investment ecosystem, its Tether having a run up on their liabilities and not having enough reserve to cover the leverage. It would not only bring down exchanges but lead to years of litigation and endless media headlines that will scare off everybody from putting fiat in. I don't know when the next Mt.Gox meltdown will occur but I can almost guarantee it will involve Tether. So stay away from it.

**What should long term investors do?**

For long term holders a good strategy to follow each year is to capture profit each December and swallow the capital gains taxation liability, park a reserve of fiat at Gemini (whose US dollar deposits are FDIC-insured) and simply wait till around late January to early February to re-enter the market at a discount and hold all year until next December. You can keep a small amount in core coins in order to trade around various Q1 opportunities you anticipate. Others may choose to simply do nothing and just keep holding throughout January which is also a perfectly fine strategy. The cyclical correction usually stabilizes toward late January and early February, then we see a rise in March and generally are recovered by end of April. Obviously this decision whether to sell in December to profit on the dip and pay tax liability or to just hold will depend on your individual tax situation. Do your own math sometime in November and follow suit. 

Essentially revaluate your positions and trim your position sizes if you don't feel comfortable with the losses.

#How to construct your portfolio going forward
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rather than seeing the correction as a disaster see it as a time to start fresh. If you have been FOMO-ing into bad cryptos and losing money now is a time to start a systematic long term approach to investing rather than gambling.
 

**Follow a methodology for evaluating each cryptocurrency**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Memes and lambo dreams are fun and all, but I know many of you are investing thousands of dollars into crypto, so its worth it to put some organized thought into it as well. I can't stress enough how important it is to try and logically contruct your investment decisions. If you follow a set methodology, a checklist and template you will be able to do relative comparisons between cryptocurrencies, to force yourself to consider the negatives and alternative scenarios and also sleep comfortably knowing you have a sound basis for your investment decisions (even if they turn out to be wrong). 

There is no ideal or ""correct"" methodology but I can outline mine:

**1) Initial information gathering and filtering**

Once I identify something that looks like a good potential investment, I first go to the CoinMarketCap page for that symbol and look at the website and blockchain explorer. 

* Critically evaluate the website. This is the first pass of the bullshit detector and you can tell from a lot from just the website whether its a scam. If it uses terms like ""Web 4.0"" or other nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and has anonymous teams, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. 

* Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. Look for red flags like massive portions of the float being assigned to the founders of the coin, vague definition of who would use the coin, anonymous teams, promises of large payouts...etc

* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts holding or selling? Which account is likely the foundation account, which is the founders account? 

* Read the subreddit and blogs for the cryptocurrency and also evaluate the community. Try to figure out exactly what the potential use cases are and look for sceptical takes. Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?


**2) Fill out an Investment Checklist**

I have a checklist of questions that I find important and as I'm researching a crypto I save little snippets in Evernote of things that are relevant to answering those questions:

* What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve?

* What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?

* Who is their competition and how big is the market they're targeting? What is the roadmap they created?

* What current product exists?

* How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?

* What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?



**3) Create some sort of consistent valuation model/framework, even if its simple** 

I have a background in finance so I like to do Excel modeling. For those who are interested in that, this [article is a great start](https://hackernoon.com/the-7-things-you-need-to-know-from-the-valuing-cryptocurrency-conference-call-c238095a03b9) and also Chris Burniske has a great blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto.

[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done using his model](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit).  You can download this and play around with it yourself, see how the formulas link and understand the logic.

Once you have a model set up the way you like in Excel you can simply alter it to account for various float oustanding schedule and market items that are unique to your crypto, and then just start plugging in different assumptions. Think about what is the true derivation of value for the coin, is it a ""dividend"" coin that you stake within a digital economy and collect fees or is it a currency? Use a realistic monetary velocity (around 5-10 for currency and around 1-2 for staking) and for the discount rate use at least 3x the long term return of a diversified equity fund.

The benefit is that this forces you to think about what actually makes this coin valuable to an actual user within the digital economy its participating in and force you to think about the assumptions you are making about the future.  Do your assumptions make sense? What would the assumptions have to be to justify its current price? You can create different scenarios in a matrix (optimistic vs. pessimistic) based on different assumptions for risk (discount rate) and implementation (adoption rates).

If you don't understand the above thats perfectly fine, you don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do

* [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. 

* Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. 

* If its meant to be just used as just a currency: Take a look at the circulating supply and look at the amount that is in cold storage or set to be released/burned. Most cryptos are deflationary so think about how the float schedule will change over time and how this will affect price. 

Once you have a model you like set up, you can compare cryptos against each other and most importantly it will require that you build a mental framework within your own mind on why somebody would want to own this coin other than to sell it to another greater fool for a higher price. Modeling out a valuation will lead  you to think long term and think about the inherent value, rather than price action.

Once you go through this 3-step methodology, you'll have a pretty good confidence level for making your decision and can comfortably sit back and not panic if some temporary short term condition leads to a price decrease. This is how ""smart money"" does it.

**Think about your portfolio allocation**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

You should think first in broad terms how you allocate between ""safe"" and ""speculative"" cryptos. 

For new investors its best to keep a substantial portion in what would be considered largecap safe cryptos, primarily BTC, ETH, LTC. I personally consider XMR to be safe as well. A good starting point is to have between 50-70% of your portfolio in these safe cryptocurrencies. As you become more confident and informed you can move your allocation into speculative small caps.

You should also think in terms of segments and how much of your total portfolio is in each segment:

* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc

* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc

* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc

* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc

* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment -VeChain, Walton, WABI...etc

* Promising/Innovative Tech segment - Raiblocks, IOTA, Cardano...etc

You should also think about where we are in the cycle, as now given so much uncertaintly its probably best to stay heavily in core holdings and pick up a few coins within a segment you understand well. If you don't understand how enterprise solutions work or how the value chain is built through corporations, don't invest in the enteprise blockchain solutions segment. If you are a technie who loves the technology behind Cardano or IOTA, invest in that segment.

**Think of your ""circle of competence""**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is actually a term Buffet came up with, it refers to your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Think about what you know best and consider investing in those type of coins. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? 

This where your portfolio allocation also comes into play. You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you had over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. 


**Continually educate yourself about the technology and markets**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you aren't already doing it: Read a bit each day about cryptocurrencies. There are decent Youtubers that talk about the market side of crypto, just avoid those that hype specific coins and look for more sceptical ones like CryptoInvestor. If you don't understand how the technology works and what the benefits of a blockchain are or how POS/POW works or what a DAG is or how mining actually works, learn first. If you don't care about the technology or find reading about it tedious, you shouldn't invest in this space at all.


#Summing it up

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I predicted a few days ago that we would have a major correction in 2018 specifically in the altcoins that saw massive gains in Decemeber/early January, and it seems we've already had a pretty big one. I don't think we'll have a complete meltdown like some are predicting, but some more pain may be incoming.

Basically take this time to think about how you can improve your investment style and strategy. Make a commitment to value things rather than chasing FOMO, and take your time to make a decision. Long term investment will grant you much more returns as will a systematic approach.

Take care and have fun investing :)

2. While scams and fraudsters must be cracked down, the general market must be allowed to develop. A working group of SEC, FINCEN, CFTC and other group members are working on identifying scams in this space.

3. When asked if Crypto has any ""intrinsic value""? - There is an intrinsic value and relation of the value of bitcoin and the cost of mining it. 

4. Price of Bitcoin is just one publicly traded company like McDonalds. In comparison, global money supply is 7.6T. And since Bitcoin has been compared to digital gold, value of all gold in the world is 8T.

I'm Truly Disappointed.,7010,7n3fxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7n3fxk/im_truly_disappointed/,363,1514690443.0,"Guys. We need to talk:

This subreddit above all else is supposed to be a hub of news, useful discourse, information, and understanding of cryptocurrencies/crypto assets in general. Through it I've found some amazing coins and made investments that I would have never known to make.

But that's only because I didn't listen to the trash level sentiment being carried out and the hardcore tribalism that causes people to lose out on good, solid investments. So here, lemme break this into 3 categories:

**FOR THE INVESTORS**

It has become incredibly clear to me that FAR too large of a portion of our reader base on this sub is entirely unaware of the fundamentals of investing in new tech. This is not a sports team, this is not some TV show or fad, THIS IS A BRAND FUCKING NEW ASSET CLASS THAT CAN REVOLUTIONIZE OUR SOCIETY. And it is MUCH too early to be acting like we've already made our correct bets and that nothing can happen to change the trajectory of our favorite project.

1) How is the TECH/Whitepaper? (this should always be your FIRST question)

2) How is the Dev Team?

3) Do they have a funding scheme? What kind? (community donation, venture capital, institutional investment/buyouts, ICO etc.)

4) How are they organized?

5) How is their track record?

6) Do they have any institutional or prolific backing?

7) Does it solve a goddamn problem or alleviate friction anywhere?

8) Does it have competition and where does it stand within that?

9) How close to ready is it?

10) Any plans to create, stimulate, and maintain adoption?

11) Does it have a Marketing and media presence? A good one?

12) How is its Mainstream visibility?

13) How about Accesibility and Liquidity?

14) Growth potential based on current price and supply

15) Can it survive or at least get around the regulatory hammer?

Regardless of what you think your coin's shit smells like, these are the things you need to know in order to decide where the hell you're putting your money. Because each and every single one of these questions is important in determining the value potential and sustainability of your coin. If you actually care about making money then you'll shed your need to be on a single team and diversify your assets based on the fundamentals. Yes, I know a month feels like an entire year in crypto, but investment is NORMALLY supposed to be a multi-decade affair. Meanwhile longterm for most of us means 2022 at the latest. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

**FOR THE DAY TRADERS**

In general, you have a very simple job. Look at graphs, do some TA, make a plan, invest based on that and do your best to have orders and trading set up that minimizes risk. So just do that. I don't want to hear a single one of you coming through a subreddit and moaning about how you think something is a shitcoin because it wasn't volatile enough that day to make you dumb amounts of money. No one is saying you aren't making hella money or that you aren't right from a daytrading perspective, but keep that to the trading subreddits where other like-minded people are actually impatient enough to care about that. You should understand that when you put up some pissy comment like that, new investors who haven't the faintest clue on anything will take what you say seriously and model their money movement around your words.

Think about that.

If I had listened to day traders, as a mid-long term investor, I'd have missed out on NEO (back when it was Antshares), ICX, and XRP. I would have missed out on the following percentage gains:

NEO: 1150% Gains as of now
ICX: 5080% Gains as of now
XRP: 1720% Gains as of now

^Why would I want to miss out on that because of impatience and bad philosophy?

**FOR THE SUPPORTERS**

For people who are genuinely in this for philosophy, that's great, discuss the merits of your philosophy and vision and why you think the coin aligns with that. Otherwise:

SHUT THE FUCK UP.

If you don't, you'll start spreading FUD and lies, it's inevitable, the second you decide to trash another coin you're going to do it as a way to feel superior regardless of how good or shitty your investment is.

I'm done.",2017-12-31 11:20:43

This is the US legal definition of Fraud:

* Fraud. A false representation of a matter of fact—whether by words or by conduct, by false or misleading allegations, **or by concealment of what should have been disclosed**—that deceives and is intended to deceive another so that the individual will act upon it to her or his legal injury.

[In order to be convicted of fraud in the US, the following must be proved:](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fraud)

>Fraud must be proved by showing that the defendant's actions involved five separate elements: 

> * (1) a false statement of a material fact,

>* (2) knowledge on the part of the defendant that the statement is untrue, 

>* (3) intent on the part of the defendant to deceive the alleged victim,

Now I'm not a lawyer but it seems to me that he is clearly guilty & convictable. It's likely the EU/Italian definition is the same since fraud is a universal crime. [He may also be guilty of running a ponzi scheme](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ponzi_scheme)

We need to make sure people don't get away with this sort of thing. I don't want to say he's destroyed people's lives because there is almost always a way to recover but he has certainly severely damaged peoples wellbeing. 

I'm in the US but if someone in the EU/Italy could contact the authorities & let them know about the situation maybe we can get a little bit of justice for his victims. I don't trust him at all when he said he has reported this to authorities, it's **very likely he completely misrepresented the situation to them** even if he did (which is also a crime).

If you live in the USA & are a victim please call the FBI to file a report. Apparently extradition is possible between the USA & Italy. If there is enough outcry about this situation maybe we can get the wheels turning.

Edit: [He's also guilty of embezzlement](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/embezzlement )

> Elements common to embezzlement are as follows: (1) the property must belong to a person other than the accused, such as an employer or principal; (2) the property must be converted subsequent to the defendant's original and lawful possession of it; (3) the defendant must be in a position of trust, so that the property is held by him or her pursuant to some fiduciary duty; and (4) the defendant must have an intent to defraud the owner at the time of the conversion.

Edit: Evidence he knew about the hack (personally I think it's borderline impossible for him not to realize he's missing over 3/4ths of the XRB in his wallet but here's some hard evidence anyways).

[The idiocy of newbies FOMO-ing into anything with low nominal value lead to endless twitter timelines like this](https://i.imgur.com/zDjmRjl.jpg), and now nobody has any idea where the market settles. What do you do now? 

In the following weeks it will be a good time to rethink your investment approach and how you arrive at your decisions. Just buying whatever is shilled on Twitter or Reddit and jumping from one crypto to another isn't going to work like it did these last two months. 

The good news is that we're finally back closer and closer to our long term moving average which is much more healthy for entrants, the bad news is that the fear might continue compounding if outstanding issues are not dealt with. [Tether is the big concern for me personally for reasons I've stated many times](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7tg8fn/tether_drama_tether_has_dissolved_relationship/dtco50g/), but some relief in the short term may come if the SEC and CFTC meeting on February 6th goes well. Nobody really knows where the bottom is but I think we're now past the ""irrational exhuberance"" stage and we're entering a period of more serious inspection where cryptos will actually have to prove themselves as useful. I suspect hype artists like CryptoNick and John McAfee will fall out of favor.

But perhaps most importantly use this as a learning experience, don't try to point fingers now. The type of dumb behavior that people were engaging in that was rewarded in a bull market (chasing pumps, going all in on a shillcoin, following hype..etc) could only ever lead to what we are experiencing now. Just like so many people jumped on the crypto bandwagon during the bull run, they will just as quickly jump on whatever bandwagon is to be used to blame for the deflation of the bubble. Nobody who pumped money into garbage without any use case will accept that they themselves with their own investing behavior were the real reason for the gross overvaluation of most cryptocurrencies, and the inevitable crash.

So if you're looking for a fresh start after the massacre (or just want to get in now), here is a guide:

#Part A: Making a Investment Strategy
---------------------------

This is your money, put some effort into investing it with an actual strategy. Some simple yet essential advice that should apply to everyone, regardless of individual strategy:

1. Slow down and research each crypto that you're buying for at least a week.

2. Don't buy something just because it has risen.

3. Don't exit a position just because it has declined.

4. Invest only as much as you can afford to lose.

5. Prepare enter and exit strategies in advance. 

First take some time to think about your ROI target, set your hold periods for each position and how much you are actually ready to risk losing.

**ROI targets**

A lot of young investors who are in crypto have unrealistic expectations about returns and risk. A lot of them have never invested in any other type of financial asset, and hence many seem to consider a 5-10% ROI in a month to be unexciting. 

But its important to temper your hype and realize why we had this exponential growth in the last year and how unlikely it is that we see 10x returns in the next year. What we saw recently was [Greater Fool Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory) in action. Those unexciting returns of 5-10% a month are much more of the norm, and much more healthy for an alternative investment class. 

You can think about setting a target in terms of the market ROI over a relevant holding period and then add or decrease based on your own risk profile.

**Example: Calculating a 2 year ROI target**

Lets say you want to hold for 2 years now, how could you set a realistic target to strive for? You could look at a historical 2 year return as a base, preferably during a period similar to what we're facing now. Now that we had a major correction, I think we can look at the two year period starting in 2015 after we had the 2014 crash. To calculate a 2 year CAGR starting in 2015:

Year  | Total Crypto Market Cap 
-------|------
Jan 1, 2015:|  $5.5 billion 
Jan 1, 2017:  | $18 billion

Compounded annual growth return (CAGR):  [(18/5.5)^(1/2)]-1 = 81%

This annual return rate of 81% comes out to about 4.9% compounded monthly. This may not sound exciting to the lambo moon crowd, but it will keep you grounded in reality. You can aim for a higher return (say 2x of that 81% rate) if you choose to take on more risky propositions. I can't tell you what return target you should set for yourself, but just make sure its not depended on you needing to achieve continual near vertical parabolic price action in small cap shillcoins because that isn't sustainable. 

Once you have a target you can construct your risk profile (low risk vs. high risk category coins) in your portfolio based on your target.

**Risk Management**

Everything you buy in crypto is risky, but it still helps to think of these 3 risk categories:

* Core holdings - This is the exchange pairing cryptos and those that are well established. These are almost sure to be around in 5 years, and will recover after any bear market. The Coinbase pairs (Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum) are in this class of risk, and I would also argue Monero.

* Medium Risk Speculative - These would be cryptos which generally have a working product and niche, but higher risk than Core. Things like ZCash and Ripple, relatively established history but still uncertainty over long term viability.

* High Risk Speculative - This is anything created within the last few months, ICOs, low caps, shillcoins...etc. Most cryptos are in this category.

How much risk should you take on? That depends on your own life situation for one, but also it should be proportional to how much expertise you have in both financial analysis and technology. 

The general starting point I would recommend is: 

* 50-70% for newbies in Low Risk Core, then you can go down to 30% as you gains confidence and experience

* Always try to keep at least a 1/3rd in safe core positions

* Don't go all in on speculative picks.

Some more core principles on risk management to consider:

* Diversify across sectors and rebalance your allocations periodically. 

* Consider using dollar cost averaging to enter a position. This generally means investing a X amount over several periods, instead of at once. You can also use downward biased dollar cost averaging to mitigate against downward risk. For example instead of investing $1000 at once in a position at market price, you can buy $500 at the market price today then set several limit orders at slightly lower intervals (for example $250 at 5% lower than market price, $250 at 10% lower than market price). This way your average cost of acquisition will be lower if the crypto happens to decline over the short term.

* Don't have more than 5-10% of your net worth in crypto.

* Have the majority of your holdings in things you feel good holding for at least 2 years. Don't use the majority of your investment for day trading or short term investing.

* Remember you didn't actually make any money until you take some profits, so take do some profits when everyone else is at peak FOMO-ing mode.

* Have some fiat in reserve at a FDIC-insured exchange (ex. Gemini), and be ready to add to your winning positions on a pullback. This should be part of your entry strategy.

* Consider what level of loss you can't accept in a position with a high risk factor, and use stop-limit orders to hedge against sudden crashes. Set you stop price at about 5-10% above your lowest limit. Stop-limit orders aren't perfect but they're better than having no hedging strategy for a risky microcap in case of some meltdown. Only you can determine what bags you are unwilling to hold.


You can think of each crypto having a risk factor that is the summation of the general crypto market risk (Rm), but also its own inherent risk specific to its own goals (Ri).

Rt = Rm +Ri

The market risk is something you cannot avoid, it is essentially the risk that is carried by the entire market over things like regulations. What you can minimize though the Ri, the specific risks with your crypto. That will depend on the team composition, geographic risks (for example Chinese coins like NEO carry regulatory risks specific to China), competition within the space and likelihood of adoption and other factors, which I'll describe in Part 2: Crypto Picking Methodology.


**Portfolio Allocation**

Along with thinking about your portfolio in terms of risk categories described above, I really find it helpful to think about the segments you are in. [OnChainFX](http://onchainfx.com/) has some segment categorization but I generally like to bring it down to:

* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc

* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc

* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc

* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc

* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment - VeChain, Walton, Factom...etc

* Promising Tech segment - NANO/Raiblock, Cardano...etc

Think about your [""Circle of Competence""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_competence), your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Your ability to properly judge risk and potential is going to largely correlated to your understanding of the subject matter. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? If you don't understand anything about the tech when you read the Cardano paper, are you really able to determine how likely it is to be adopted?

Consider the [historic correlations between your holdings](https://cointrading.ninja/correlation). Generally when Bitcoin pumps, altcoins dump but at what rate depends on the coin. When Bitcoin goes sideways we tend to see pumping in altcoins, while when Bitcoin goes down, everything goes down. 

You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you have over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. 


#Part B: Crypto Picking Methodology (Due Dilligence)
------------------------------------------

Do you struggle on how to fundamentally analyze cryptocurrencies? Here is a 3-step methodology to follow to perform your due dilligence:

# Step 1: Filtering and Research

There is so much out there that you can get overwhelmed. The best way to start is to think back to your own portfolio allocation strategy and what you would like to get more off. For example in my view enterprise-focused blockchain solutions will be important in the next few years, and so I look to create a list of various cryptos that are in that segment.

[Upfolio has brief descriptions of the top 100 cryptos and is filterable by categories](https://www.upfolio.com/100-coins-explained), for example you can click the ""Enterprise"" category and you have a neat list of VEN, FCT, WTC...etc.

Once you have a list of potential candidates, its time to read about them:

* Critically evaluate the website. If it's a cocktail of nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and poorly made, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. 

* Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. 

* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts selling? Try to figure out who the whales are (not always easy!) and what the foundation/founder account is based on the initial allocation.

* Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?

* Search out the subreddit and look at a few Medium or Steem blogs about the coin. How ""shilly"" is the community, and how much engagement is there between developer and the community?

* I would also go through the BitcoinTalk thread and Twitter mentions, judge both the length and quality of the discussion.

You can actually filter out a lot of scams and bad investments by simply keeping your eye out on the following red flags:

* allocations that give way too much to the founder

* guaranteed promises of returns (Bitcooonnneeeect!)

* vague whitepapers filled with buzzwords

* vague timelines and no clear use case

* Github with no useful code and sparse activity

* a team that is difficult to find information on 

#Step 2: Passing a potential pick through a checklist

Once you feel fairly confident that a pick is worth analyzing further, run them through a standardized checklist of questions. This is one I use, you can add other questions yourself:

Crypto Analysis Checklist |
---------|
What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve? |
What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized? |
How big is the market they're targeting? |
Who is their competition and what does it do better? |
What is the roadmap they created and how well have they kept to it? |
What current product exists? |
How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional? |
Is there any new tech, and is it informational or governance based? |
Can it be easily copied? |
What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?  |

The last question is the most important. 

This is where the riskiness of your crypto is evaluated, the Ri I talked about above. Here you should be able to accurate place the crypto into one of the three risk categories. I also like to run through this checklist of blockchain benefits and consider which specific properties of the blockchain are being used by the specific crypto to provide some increased utility over the current transactional method:

Benefits of Cryptocurrency |
---------|
Decentralization - no need for a third party to agree or validate transactions. |
Transparency and trust - As blockchain are shared, everyone can see what transactions occur. Useful for something like an online casino. |
Immutability - It is extremely difficult to change a transaction once its been put onto a blockchain |
Distributed availability - The system is spread on thousands of nodes on a P2P network, so its difficult to take the system down. |
Security - cryptographically secured transactions provide integrity |
Simplification and consolidation - a blockchain can serve as a shared ledger in industries where multiple entities previously kept their own data sources |
Quicker Settlement - In the financial industry when we're dealing with post-trade settlement, a blockchain can drastically increase the speed of verification |
Cost - in some cases avoiding a third party verification would drastically reduce costs. |


#Step 3: Create a valuation model

You don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do:

**Probablistic Scenario Valuation**

This is all about thinking of scenarios and probability, a helpful exercise in itself. For example: Bill Miller, a prominent value investor, [wrote a probabilistic valuation case for Bitcoin in 2015](http://dev.lmminvestments.com/a-value-investors-case-for-bitcoin/). He looked at two possible scenarios for probabalistic valuation:

1. becoming a store-of-value equal to gold (a $6.4 trillion value), with a .25% probability of occurring
2.  replacing payment processors like VISA, MasterCard, etc. (a $350 million dollar value) with a 2.5% probability

Combining those scenarios would give you the total expected market cap: (0.25% x 6.4 trillion) + (2.5% x 350 million). Divide this by the outstanding supply and you have your valuation.


**Metcalfe's Law**

[Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. We can alter this to crypto by thinking about it in terms of both users and transactions:

For example, compare the Coinbase pairs:

Metric | Bitoin | Ethereum  | Litecoin
---------|----------|----------|----------
Market Cap | $152 Billion | $93 Billion | $7.3 Billion
Daily Transactions (last 24hrs) | 249,851| 1,051,427 | 70,397
Active Addresses (Peak 1Yr) | 1,132,000 |1,035,000 | 514,000
Metcalfe Ratio (Transactions Based)| 2.43 | 0.08 | 1.47
Metcalfe Ratio (Address Based)| 0.12| 0.09 | 0.03

Generally the higher the ratio, the higher the valuation given for each address/transaction.

**Market Cap to Industry comparisons**

Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. 

**More complex valuation models**

If you would like to get into more fleshed out models with Excel, I highly recommend Chris Burniske's blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an [equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto](https://medium.com/@cburniske).

[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done by Nodar Janashia using Chris' model ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit). 

You should create multiple scenarios with multiple assumptions, both positive and negative. Have a base scenario and then moderately optimistic/pessimistic and highly optimistic/pessimistic scenario.

Personally I like to see at least a 50% upward potential before investing from my moderately pessimistic scenario, but you can set your own safety margin.

The real beneficial thing about modelling isn't even the price or valuation comparisons it spits out, but that it forces you to think about why the coin has value and what your own assumption about the future are. For example the discount rate you apply to the net present utility formula drastically affects the valuation, and it reflects your own assumptions of how risky the crypto is. What exactly would be a reasonable discount rate? What about the digital economy you are assuming for the coin, what levers affects its size and adoption and how likely are your assumptions to come true? You'll be a drastically more intelligent investor if you think about the fundamental variables that give your coin the market cap you think it should hold.


#Summing it up
------------------------------------------

The time for lambo psychosis is over. But that's no reason to feel down, this is a new day and what many were waiting for. I've put together in one place here how to construct a portfolio allocation (taking into consideration risk and return targets), and how to go through a systematic crypto picking method. I'm won't tell you what to buy, you should always decide that for yourself and DYOR. But as long as you follow a rational and thorough methodology (feel free to modify anything I said above to suit your own needs) you will feel pretty good about your investments, even in times like these.

"If you think banks/credit companies are banning crypto purchases to protect their customers, I have a bridge to sell you.",5405,7v1m8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7v1m8d/if_you_think_bankscredit_companies_are_banning/,767,1517716308.0,"I'm legitimately blown away how many people I see defending the banks/credit companies banning crypto purchases as some type of attempt to protect their customers from a volatile market. Credit is predatory by nature. The bank doesn't care when you max your card out on alcohol, designer clothes, gambling, or any other worthless and risky commodity. Your bank doesn't give one single tiny little shit about you in any way beyond your capacity to generate revenue. You are a revenue generating unit and nothing more, end of story. They are building artificial barriers to crypto because they view it as a direct and fundamental threat to their industries... and with good reason, because it is. The reality is anyone who invests wisely in crypto right now is going to make a significant ROI over the next few years, opening up the opportunity to pay off large balances, which decreases the revenue they earn from interest. This is nothing more than a desperate attempt at self preservation. 

Again I would encourage anyone who has their bank or credit card company create a barrier for them to purchase crypto, to immediately end doing business with that institution and make sure they know why. If my bank halts my purchases, I'll liquidate my account and close it the same day. Same goes with my credit cards, they will get cut up and never used again. DON'T bend over for them.

"Sell walls: What they are, what they do, and how to spot them.",4894,7nqts3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7nqts3/sell_walls_what_they_are_what_they_do_and_how_to/,449,1514968466.0,"Browsing reddit, see a lot of people asking what sell walls are, and an equal number of people giving a poor explanation of their actual purpose. I was going to reply in a comment, but I feel that a lot of people can benefit from a short write-up on them.

#What is a sell wall?

A sell wall is a tool used by a rich individual,or group of rich individuals, to manipulate the price of a stock downwards. A large sell order is set at a specific price by the whale(s) to prevent higher sell orders from executing.

A sell wall looks like this on the depth chart: http://brettwestbrook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-12.58.10-PM.png

###How does it work?

This is best explained as an example.

A wealthy person, we will call him Richard, tells a group of his wealthy friends that he wants to make money on a particular stock. This could be for a number of reasons such as:

* The stock has a lot of room to grow
* The stock can be easily manipulated
* The stock has a lot of potential to get big in the near future

Richard and his friends decide that it's a good idea. They all want 1 million of X cryptocurrency. *Unfortunately, in the cryptocurrency market Richard and his friends can't execute all the buy orders at once or the prices will skyrocket!* 


To achieve 1 million obtained goal, they decide to set up a sell wall, and manipulate the price downwards. They do this in steps:

1. They accumulate together. They will maybe get 250,000 of X crypto each. In their specific market, this didn't affect the price that much. Great! 

2. They now set a specific price they feel is low enough for them to be able to reach their 1m X crypto goal. For this particular crypto they decide to all sell their obtained crypto at $2.40.

3. Now, between Richard and the group, there is >1 million dollars worth of X crypto selling for @2.40 on the market, a seemingly undervalued price.There is SO much volume being sold now, buying pressure cannot eat through that wall in a reasonable time frame - it would take a very high buying pressure to do so. 

What also happens next is the key: nobody else can sell above that sell wall price until it's gone. The result? People need to sell lower than the sell wall in order to liquefy their stock. This drives the price downwards.

Richard and his friends can now safey all get to their 1m X crypto mark without raising the price exponentially! When they decide to rid their sell walls the price moves up accordingly!

##How can you use this to your advantage?

A common thought is that the main goal of a sell wall is to instill fear into the weaker hands so that they sell by the thought that ""Oh no everyone is selling!!"" While it's not the main purpose, it probably does happen a little bit. People get nervous when things a large volume of crypto is being sold.

As Warren Buffet said: *Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful.*

For a real life example:

VECHAIN. 

For those that don't know, about a month ago vechain was sitting around 29 cents. They had a pretty large announcement that was, yes, front page of reddit. The price nearly doubled to 70 cents (it actually happened right before the announcement). 

What happened after? Some people bought the rumor and sold the news. But, this news was really big. Masternodes, rebranding, big partnerships. Ask any VEN holder why the price didn't continue to rise after that and they will probably know why - price manipulation with sell walls.

Such as: https://i.redd.it/bjaubsgn04601.png

VECHAIN has had a lot of new partnerships, announcements, and generally great news to propel the crypto further, but has been held back by these sells walls constantly. Just recently buying pressure has been very high and the whales have been having trouble controlling it they way they would like.

That's a real example of what has been happening. Take a look at roadmaps and see where different projects are at in development. Are any projects getting seemingly great news without moving in price?

What about REQ? We saw a couple of front page posts about REQ moving to main net, quality pictures from the UI, etc etc. REQ was fairly stagnant around 30 cents before slingshotting to 80 cents in nearly a day. Sell walls and price manipulation.This field is speculative so any news drives buying pressure. Unfortunately, the very wealthy have a say as well. 

Look for great projects and determine if they solve a need. Look to see what's hitting the media's spot light, such as the front page here. **THEN take a look at the depth charts on the exchanges.** In crypto anything goes, and you better believe the very wealthy have difficult to obtain knowledge. When you see these obvious sell walls, you want to investigate and try to identify any trends. 

Perhaps you can look at **volume** of a cryptocurrency. A stagnant crypto with LOTS of volume is a huge indicator, sideways consolidation. Ripple did this for a few weeks, even months at certain stages. 

Once you find one that looks good - **you'll need to hold at the mercy of the whales.** Trust me, they want profit more than you do. The wait is almost always worth it because price will rise very rapidly once selling pressure is completely abolished.

This event was an invite-only occasion for media and partners with a live stream to YouTube. During the event, Sunny Lu and Luca Crisciotti of DNV GL talked about the past, present, and future of VeChain. 

Sunny clarified that VeChain's uniqueness is not only technical but also its understanding of ecosystems. He pointed to the governance and economic models as examples. This sentiment was echoed by Luca as he assured everyone that after meeting with countless blockchain solution representatives he chose VeChain as the partner for DNV GL because of their understanding and dedication to the customer. 

This mindset has lead to over 180 opportunities for VeChain in 2018. Many of these opportunities are left unannounced, but in the course of the event, VeChain announced several new partners and opportunities including the University of Oxford Mathematical Institute, Carbon Bank solutions, BitOcean ICO, food sourcing, and BMW Group. 

Also in this event, Sunny Lu showcased three decentralized applications (DApps) that are being built to cater towards the mainnet launch. Those DApps include:

* VeVID -  KYC and digital ID maintenance solution that can be native to all VeChain applications or partners. [You can read the official announcement here.](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechains-first-official-public-infrastructural-decentralized-application-vevid-cd97bdf98670) 

* VeVOT - A voting service that will be initially used by the VeChain governance model. This solution will be available for other general voting events to be logged on the blockchain such as government voting and board votes. Voting results will be audited by independent partners and certified on the blockchain. 

* VeSCC - Smart contracts on the VeChainThor mainnet can be categorized into certified and uncertified, which can be checked in the explorer. The certification of smart contracts covers various aspects including the identity of the owner, the legality of the purpose, and the security of the source code. 

At the event, the carbon bank solution was made public to raise awareness that VeChain is building solutions alongside DNV GL that will monitor, analyze, and reduce the carbon footprint. This solution is being used and researched by universities (Tsinghua University), businesses, and government bodies.

In this event Sunny Lu took the time to introduce the University of Oxford (Mathematical Institute) as a partner in the VeChain ecosystem and will be working on assuring the economic model is working as intended for VET holders, VeThor users, and new customers. It was also mentioned that Japanese FSA certified partner BitOcean would be the first ICO on VeChainThor.

Luca Crisciotti left with words of encouragement of VeChain “We are not talking about pilot projects, we are talking about solutions that are working for real cases.” Luca went on to say:“DNV GL is a company with over 150 years of history. And unfortunately, this is something we can not share, because you [VeChain] were only born a few months ago. But we do have something in common, and it's a bright future. So thank you Sunny for the partnership and this amazing event.”

Anyone else experience a similar issue? Is there any chance to get the money back? Do they just ignore all tickets and try to pocket all the money before they close shop for good?

My case is more delayed and severe.

Nine days ago, i made a transaction from Coinone to Bittrex Exchange.
But there is no deposit in my Bittrex wallet and no pending deposit.

Bittrex Exchange do not solve my problem for 9 days. They do not properly respond to me on twitter, facebook messenger, and support tickets. They replied only automated texts.

The account explorer shows its perfectly correct. But i cant find my 333230 XRPs, worth more than 300000 USD. What can I do? For 9 days, I just click and click refresh button every seconds. 

It's all about my money. Why this terrible situation happen in my life. It's a nightmare. Someone cheers me XRP price elevating. But i dont have that XRP, now.

Frankly speaking, I feel some psychotic problem. When i see price up, i feel manic. But when i see my empty wallet, i feel depressed. It has repeated 9 days. I lost my weight 4kgs for 9days.

A transfer from an external wallet/platform to GDAX appeared in all of our Coinbase accounts, and then said that it transferred successfully to our GDAX accounts, but then never showed up in our GDAX accounts. So it would appear our money is gone, because our balances are zero.  We’ve all opened tickets with support with absolutely no responses, posted on their subreddit, and called to only be on hold for hours without any help. I really don’t know what else to do except try to get us on the front page of a bigger crypto community.

More details about this issue are here https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/7mx88o/urgent_coinbase_to_gdax_transfer_disappeared/?st=JBUBPP35&sh=a19f1463

Thank you so much for your help to anybody who can spare an upvote to bring some attention to this.

If anybody from Coinbase finally wants to help, my support ticket number is 3221822

UPDATE: there’s a comment response from the Coinbase CEO, saying they’ll get to our tickets. Since I doubt they’ll respond again to me (and my balance is still 0 on GDAX so basically this whole issue was still not enough to fix our problem) - here’s my response:

What proof do I have that my coins are not lost? My balance on GDAX is 0, and my LTC balance on Coinbase is 0. This kind of thing should be a priority issue if people are getting balances of 0 on GDAX with an automatic send to their wallet transfer from Coinbase to GDAX like this. I’m even more frustrated that with 3.5k upvotes and a response, my LTC balance is still 0 from an error on their side.

One last clarification: I do not have any pending transfer issues (these I’m familiar with an have learned to wait). The transaction on the blockchain finished, the funds even appeared in my Coinbase account. The automatic transfer from Coinbase to GDAX (which has happened at least 5-10 times with no issues for me) this time withdrew the money from my Coinbase account and said the deposit to GDAX was completed. But my balance is 0 for LTC on Coinbase and 0 on GDAX, so this last move to GDAX (which is supposed to be instant, and says completed) zeroed my LTC balance. My balance has been 0 LTC for over 3 days now. This has nothing to do with their wire transfers, although I really feel for everyone still waiting on their withdrawals and hope they resolve that soon.

UPDATE: it’s been 4 days and still missing all of my LTC

UPDATE: 5 days now. No more holidays. I have no faith in crypto exchanges anymore.

6 days now. What a joke. I’ll post the next update in 6 months when my support ticket gets addressed and if I’m lucky they’ll fix our problem.

FINAL UPDATE: Fixed finally after 6 and a half days.  My account has been transferred the litecoin that were missing, thank you so much everyone on reddit for bringing attention to this. I really owe everyone because I had no power at all over this situation and I like to think this post helped get Coinbase to at least address this issue. It would appear others are still having problems with this Coinbase to GDAX transfer, or at least haven’t had their missing coins returned yet, just as an FYI. Thank you so much again everybody!!!!",2018-01-01 05:20:49

1. CMC removed Korean exchanges
2. Prices/graphs instantly tanked (but in practice not relevant to people outside Korea who dont trade there anyhow)
3. Large number of people did not recognize what actually happened and that there were not moves/selling on their western exchanges
4. Those same people are now dumping large amount of coins trying to ""cut loses"" because of the false impression that coin is crashing.
5. Random stuff happening

My opinion is that this should have been handled much better by CMC.

Here’s a reminder for y’all lurkers here or a wake up call for people who actually take the time of day to shitpost:

1. Nobody who’s even close to being a big player or is knowledgeable about the market is wasting their time on fucking r/cryptocurrency 

2. Most “advice” you get on here is from hodlboys or plain shills trying to jerk their own dicks by echoing the same copy paste moon statements. By the occasional mercy of god there’s a post that makes life worth living but those are usually rare. This post is also not one of them.

3. No you won’t get rich hodling a mass shilled top 100 coin for a week, a month, maybe a year. Jesus Christ if it took early bitcoin miners years to go from a couple hundred to almost 20k you won’t make it with a short term focus.

4. Putting a couple hundred or thousand dollars does not make you an “investor” or at all knowledgeable about blockchain. Losing your money sucks learn from mistakes instead of dragging others down. 

5. Comments that say “3k next it’s over boys” with 30 upvotes does NOT legitimize that claim, assume it’s 31 idiots sharing a herd mentality with no basis for their arbitrary prediction.

6. Anything that has to do with price on r/cryptocurrency should not be taken as financial advice. Nobody on this sub actually know which way the markets will turn, TA works in very niche circumstances and cannot predict movements based around obvious facts or fundamental trends.

That’s all I have to say for now, my fingers are tired. I’ve been in the space for some years now and this sub is a place I frequent despite all the cancerous shit I see daily. The memes are fucking comedy gold and I will always love you guys for being here with me.

TL;DR do your own fucking research and don’t listen to anyone announcing the direction this market is heading.

EDIT: Some people apparently are not seeing the point of this post or get some kind of joy mocking if. Allow me to make some things clear:

No I’m not angry or have any personal salt nor am I projecting my expectations of what this sub SHOULD be but rather I’m only letting people know what this sub IS at the moment and what to be wary for. I was once new to the space and foolishly trusted the advice stemming from fickle sentiments and made mistakes doing so. All I hope to achieve with this post is for people to realize that this is not the place for accurate predictions regarding market movement and to be careful, That’s all.

This sub is a mess and needs to get out of the anger stage: How to move forward from the crash if you're a bagholder,3365,9zgq8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9zgq8x/this_sub_is_a_mess_and_needs_to_get_out_of_the/,392,1542941162.0,"[Back in December 2017 I did a valuation attempt of Bitcoin](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7n47be/i_built_these_3_fundamental_valuation_models_for/) on this sub and got around 5K with some grossly optimistic assumptions. Its taken a long time but finally gone down below that.

You've probably heard many people tell you it would eventually happen back in December 2017 and to reduce expose to crypto [(including me)](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7l7k9i/daily_general_discussion_december_21_2017/drl2esi/), but when you're hyped up on 20% gains every week its hard to be cautious or engage in defensive measures. To many the last quarter of 2017 and into early 2018 was like a beach party with coke and Victoria Secret models. Who wants to listen to someone tell you about how you're gonna crash hard with a headache the next morning?

With this latest crash, Bitcoin's price is back to roughly mid October 2017, which is roughly when the mainstream mania started. Many on this sub entered after October 2017 and hence are now left holding heavy bags. Many are down 80% or even 90%.  Here is the current losses from ATH for the top cryptos:

Asset | Loss from ATH
-- | --
BTC | -77%
XRP | - 88%
ETH | -90%
BCH | -95%
XLM | -79%
EOS | -83%
LTC | -91%
ADA | -96%
XMR | -85%
TRN | -96%

**Who do we blame?**
--------------------------------------------------

At a time like this its easy to get angry, to look at someone to blame. Whether Roger Ver and the hash wars, whether BAAKT delay, whether whales or SEC or institutions, everyone has their favorite boogeyman. No one thing is the reason why the market is down 80%. 

The reality is that Bitcoin (and all other crypto by extension) was ovevalued even by grossly overoptimistic measures. Its not BAKKT or the whales trying to get your coins for cheap. The same people who were buying at near peak bubble thinking they were getting into the chance of a lifetime are prone to look for someone to blame for their losses, when it was actually their fault for buying near the end of a mania. 

Nobody wants to admit that it was their own greed, lack of research and irrational behavior that lead to the gross overvaluation of all cryptocurrency.

**Is it over yet?**
--------------------------------------------------

The $6K consolidation was likely a result of the market coiling tighter and tighter around the mining breakeven point for some of the smaller miners. The big firms in China are profitable mining below 6K, but many smaller ones in the US and Europe aren't. You can actually [see the total hash rate going down](https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/hash-rate). Once it broke it was a big fall straight down. 

Bitcoin is mined at 12.5 BTC. per block at 10 minute blocks, which comes out to around 1800 BTC every day. This 1800 BTC has to be absorbed by every day, which means the following at different price levels:

Price Level | Daily net buying needed to absorb mined coins
---|---
6000 | $10.8 million/day
4500 | $8.1 million/day
3000 | $5.4 million/day

At the current price, at least theoretically $8.4 million in demand is needed to cover the mining output. Of course the miners don't immediately dump it all, but it shows why miners have an incentive to keep the price high and try to incite FOMO with a BGD. 

I can also see that after this latest drop, the ""buy the dip"" sentiment had substantially gone down, at least compared to the other fast drops in price. This is especially discouraging those who were waiting for the ""November bull run"", which never came. Its clear to more people now that this probably isn't just downward correction that will reverse, but a multiyear bear market. This is why the bounce has been so weak compared to earlier in the year. Compare that to the last two big 2 day drops:

* March 29 - April 1st (drop from 8K to 6K): Within 2 days it bounced back up to 7.5K

* June 22-24 (drop from 6.8K to 5.8K): Within 2 days it bounced back to 6.3K

The weakness of this current bounce says it all, people are no longer optimistic that BAKKT or ETF or any other catalyst will lead to a bull run that they can cash out quick. It may be a period of stagnation followed by further drops as big holders take profits.

I also think that the FED tightening with rate hikes is leading to a lot more volatility not only in stocks, but crypto as well. Right now asset deflation seems to be a global macro risk as cheap credit dries up, and Bitcoin surely isn't immune from this.

My personal view is that at this point we may see further declines, but calling what's going to happen next is always dangerous. A whale (especially a big mining operation) with a series of large orders to clear out the order book on Bitfinex could give us a BGD out of nowhere at any time and take us back to 6K, it would be interesting to see how the market reacts to something like that. But I'm not betting on it leading to any sustained rally past 10K. Quite the opposite.

---------------------------------------------------

So what's a crypto shrimp to do? I'll split my thoughts into two, for those who are still in the green and those in the loss.

**If you're still in the green**
--------------------------------------------------


If you're still in profit, this is a great time to consider how much more downward selling you can take and also how you can hedge downward risk.

If you're someone who purchased when Bitcoin was below $1000, you should [calculate your compounded annual ROI](https://financial-calculators.com/roi-calculator) and decide if that return is good enough for you. For equities, the long term average is about 10% per year, 20-30% in a good bull market. 

Its your decision, but taking out profits that exceed principal and reinvesting the principal is not at all a bad idea. For those who invested before Bitcoin reached $1K (April 2017) the current price is still an insane return that no other asset class can match.

Another important thing is to think about how you can hedge the risk of downward movement. This is where derivative exchanges are very useful, although you do need to do some research on how derivatives work and how to not get liquidated. If you have substantial holdings, the effort to learn this is worth it. 

The basic idea is that you can buy short contracts that increase in value as Bitcoin goes down, proportional to the amount of leverage you put to finance the contract. If managed correctly, you can protect your entire stack with a portion as leverage. Its something commonly done by miners, who short Bitcoin with derivatives to hedge their holdings.

**If you're in the loss**
--------------------------------------------------


The untold reality is that HODL is a meme told to newbies to prevent panic selling during a downturn while the smart money cashes out in a more orderly fashion. But does that mean you shouldn't hold if you're already down massively? 

Well that depends on your own life situation, how much you've invested, and if you don't need the money for the next few years.

Mathematically, whether it drops to 4.5K or 3K from the reference of 6K is highly meaningful, its a drop of 25% or 50%. But if your reference starting point is much higher, then it really doesn't matter all that much. A drop from 17K to 4.5K is a 74% loss while down to 3K it would be 82%, massive losses either way. In that sense if this is money you don't need, it makes sense to simply have it stored in a wallet and forget about it for a few years. Who cares if it drops further after a certain point if you don't plan to take it out for a while? Its like in equities markets where people with massive losses don't sell, but instead move the loss position into their retirement fund where they don't plan to take it out for a long time and thus are giving it time to rebound back.

But what if its money you need? What if like many out there you took out loans hoping to catch a run to 50K? If you have high interest debt (credit cards...etc), focus on paying that down first. Credit cards generally have high interest and many compound daily, so pay down the debt first rather than trying to pay your debts off with a crypto bull run that may take years to materialize.

This is also a good learning opportunity. It is worrying how few people who hold crypto have a clue what any of this even is or how it works. [I've always recommended this video to explain how Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) actually work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4).

A good thing to do during catastrophic losses is to honestly access why you got suckered into buying high in the first place. Most people here are young, and this is a valuable lesson in why you shouldn't follow the herd.  Everyone is a genius in a bull market, everyone is chasing the next hype. Crypto tends to attract people looking for a get-rich-quick-without-effort crowd, but it takes some mental effort to understand this beyond the buzzwords. Take the time to understand the fundamental reasons why an asset has value and what factors would drive its rise once the hype dies down. What makes Bitcoin valuable, what makes some of the other cryptoassets valuable? If those fundamentals in some way changes, so should your opinion. 

Its also a great opportunity to help in its adoption by using it. The irony of it all is that people demand that they get rich because of the hard work of buying a bunch of crypto in an exchange and transferring it to their wallet, without any understanding what they're buying into. 

Also don't be angry. Don't look to blame. Look to learn and improve next time you invest.

6. Market takes a dump and the Hedge Funds Made Billions buying BTC Low and selling high while at the same time NAILING their short call on Future Market.

OK GREAT HEIST RIGHT?  BUT WAIT THATS NOT ALL.

7. Hedge Funds Managers and Wealthy Elite go LONG on BCME Future which is due 10 days after the first futures call.
8. Market takes a complete nose dive back to 9k and gues who is their to start buying again?  Thats right the Hedge Fund Managers and Wealthy Elite.
9. With their newly made BILLIONS the Hedge Fund Managers push the price back up over course of 7 days in order to hit their LONG CALL on 2nd Futures market.

If you see a spike in the price of BTC and overall market cap after 1pm PST today (when 1st future call settles) you will have witnessed one of the greatest robberies of ALL TIME.

EDIT:  PLEASE NOTICE THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE USING AD HOMINEM ATTACKS ON ME BECAUSE I POST TO r/conspiracy  TELLING HUH?

EDIT 2: We dont need regulation we need innovative blockchain companies that would squash this.... There are financial disrupters working on this as we speak...... These companies will be truly change finance like Orbitz changed the travel industry.

EDIT 3: 30 Minutes till settlement and BTC is up close to $1000 in the last hour.
EDIT 4: 30 Minutes after close of 1st future BTC up another $1000 That is a $2000 spike in an hour and a half.

EDIT 5: Thank you kind souls that gave me gold.... I wonder if I can buy StrongHands With it? Also let me set the record straight..... I DONT KNOW SHIT.

Due to the amount of notice crypto has been getting lately with 50 cent’s accidental millions and Katy Perry’s crypto-nails, a lot of people are thinking this is the perfect time to make a major push for adoption. There’s currently a huge problem with people who don’t own coins, a lot of them agree that they’re not invested because it’s “fake” money with no actual use. So, we as crypto-owners want to **demand** the right to use the gains we’ve made to purchase real goods.

Now, we’re starting the hashtag #PayWithCrypto. We’re demanding our favorite companies like amazon, eBay, Walmart, etc, to let us pay with cryptocurrency!

All it takes is a simple tweet like “Hey @Amazon, I want to #PayWithCrypto” to show companies we are serious about this. I would appreciate the upvotes to help us get the word out and show the world how serious the community is about worldwide adoption of crypto!",2018-01-26 14:15:27

*Decentralized?
Bitmain and a small group of big miners control mining in almost all ASIC minable coins. NiceHash offers criminals the ability to attack smaller coins attempting to have more decentralized gpu mining. Non minable coins by their creation aren't decentralized. Sorry they may not be scams but they are definitely not decentralized

*Leaders in the community acting like wallstreet dicks? 
I have to read Charlie praising Tapjets a company that rents fucking private jets, for their crypto payment implementation. Ver doesn't need explaining.  The rest going to NYC and partying at $2000 a head conventions.....Da fuck?

*Rampant market manipulation?
Ok crypto may have been built on this but its blatantly systematic now! The hope of institutional money coming in was to help legitimize crypto markets..... foreseeable backfire there.

*Community that values ""the tech"" over lambos?
Many from the early community cashed out during the boom and were replaced by get rich hopers. Trying to have a conversation with some people on something thats wrong besides Charts and Price is getting harder and harder.

- I clearly highlighted to them the risks and rewards of investing and the best investment is to invest in the tech of the coin by doing the right research first, that doesn't matter though since all they are seeing is the price NOW and all coins are down now. 
- I explicitly told them to avoid some scam coins such as bitconnect (and they did so thats good) but again it doesn't matter now since everything is down, the scam coins with the good coins. 
- No I don't expect people to thank me for introducing them to crypto, I only mentioned this part to highlight how they only remembered me when the market dipped. 
- I learned the lesson the hard way, so fuck me sideways if I ever try to talk about crypto to anyone else IRL again 
- Yes I believe the whole market will bounce back soon, do your own research on why crypto was created in the first place. 
- I won't recommend any coins here in this post because the point of this post is not shilling, please do your own research and decide 
- Remember, you only lose / profit when sell, all the numbers you see in your portfolio apps are just that, numbers. 


Original Post:

Mid November I started talking about crypto with my family and friends and gave them a little ""push"" to start investing small amounts to experiment... I wanted them to make some money because I know they could really use it and I explained how volatile the market rn and the rewards and risk they would have to take and strongly advised them to never ever invest what they can't afford to lose

Some of them got really invested and saw some big gains and started to show off their percentage gains on social media (which is stupid but whatever). 

Noone really thanked me for introducing them to crypto when they made some big gains, they all acted like they got into it because they were smart (before I introduced them to crypto they thought bitcoin was a physical golden coin and can't be bought in fraction), but again whatever I didn't do it for people to thank me I just wanted them to make some money because I know they needed some. 

Fast forward to today morning and FUCK.MY.LIFE I opened my phone and I find a barrage of messages from them accusing me of scamming them and tricking them into crypto because they lost money, I tried to explain to them that this is normal and it will bounce back soon and it's just a correction and don't sell but they aren't listening most of them sold and ""cut their loses"" before the ""bubble burst"".

I am never going to talk about crypto with anyone in real life again, fuck em I am not getting involved in this shitty situation ever again",2018-01-18 02:55:54

Before Kucoin was added as an exchange, I played around day trading on bitgrail to see if I could gain some more Nano. Turned out to be (probably) one of the worst decisions of my life. I've decided that the only way to deal with this is to move on as quickly as possible and keep making solid decisions. Negative emotions in times like these serve no one. I will continue to invest in cryptocurrency to the degree that I believe it has potential, and if it does, the worst decision I can make right now is stopping. I will be much, much more careful with exchanges in the future.

Bitgrail's statement on the hack can be found, here:

I've been trying to withdraw for a month, but their 10 BTC/day limit screwed me. I was verified quite early and had to pull out small amounts at a time for a very long time. Eventually, their 10 BTC/day limit tended toward something like 1 BTC, and my support tickets weren't answered.

Essentially the worker there told me that it's their policy that they don't allow cryptocurrency activity and that I wouldn't be allowed to open an account with them unless I guaranteed that I wouldn't be doing that. 

I asked to speak to the branch manager, not expecting to change their mind on the decision but more for an explanation. and she told me it's a huge fraud risk and money laundering issue for them and for that reason they have been taking action against accounts that have activity from exchanges.

Hearing this I went on a mini rant about how exchanges have started following KYC and AML regulations, crypto is a technical marvel, blah blah blah, pretty much no different than the shilling that goes on here.

Apparently she was so impressed that she asked for my contact details and now she wants me do to a 15 minute talk + Q&A session with her and her colleagues discussing cryptocurrency. I actually said yes cause I saw an opportunity for a job down the line lol but here lies my problem. 

Clearly I know more than her about it but I definitely don't know enough about crypto to do a detailed talk and feel confident answering questions. I'm only a year 2 finance student IDK jack shit about anything in this industry.

The retail investor community has the memory and logic of a literal goldfish.,2903,c657ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/c657ly/the_retail_investor_community_has_the_memory_and/,555,1561669098.0,"It has been just under three years since I've joined the subreddit, and just over three years since I started being interested in cryptocurrency. After countless hours of research on the various industries being disrupted, after reading whitepapers, parsing through the profile of team members, watching recorded conferences and making calculations based on demand and market size, I can write with full confidence that the overwhelming majority of the community of crypto investors is retarded. Never have I seen a market that is less focused on growth objectives, or that circlejerks harder to news and announcements whose impact they don't even try to measure or fully understand.

In all honesty, it's not *that* surprising. The tech itself is more or less difficult to understand (anyone with an engineering, computer science, economics or finance background *should* be able to grasp the underlying concepts and realize why distributed ledgers have vale, despite not being familiar with every key concept) but the extremely hard part is picturing exactly how efficiencies are bound to be created on an industrial level, and how impactful they will be. In other markets, this is why there exist ratings, panels of experts, consulting groups. They perpetually gauge the health of various industries and make predictions based on trends, to help others make informed decisions. Even then, a layer of speculation (and thus, manipulation) always exists, but the ratio of speculation vs. real demand tends to be in a different league entirely.

Despite knowing or suspecting this, however, the same shit happens **every time** here. Bitcoin starts to drop, and the trolls come out of the woods to spread their depressive thoughts onto everyone else. Altcoins start to shine, and the morons who bought during the frenzy and are seeing 10% gains for the first time in weeks, months, if not ever, start tugging each other and patting themselves in the back and writing essays as to why DPoS experiment #898 (which doesn't even have a main net yet) is on track to being massively adopted and is *definitely* the best buy opportunity of the decade. Bitcoin starts to rise again, and suddenly all money floods from the rest of the market to feed Big Daddy and every single other project is a shitcoin again and they'll never amount to anything ever.

It is beyond frustrating to see how easily everyone is being manipulated. Short-term fluctuations in the market doesn't make you right, and it doesn't make you wrong either. There are basically *zero* candid discussions on the state of the technology and ***how it stands relative to adoption.*** There are basically *zero* attempts to map out the ecosystem in a comprehensive way so that 'investors' can have a clear picture of how some projects might interact with each other, allowing us to formulate enlightened guesses as to how much market share each might capture. Nobody seems to give a shit about decentralization *at all*, but I suspect for the vast majority, it was never about freedom and fairness, only profits.

Everybody strictly only celebrates when the market moves up without ever questioning the validity of that movement. When an asset inflates without any fundamental reason, its only achievement is the creation of a bubble that will inevitably result in severe losses for the majority of investors. 

With the size of this community (this subreddit alone), we have the power to warn others and to influence the market by infusing some rationality into it. So please, take the time to encourage others to look beyond immediate gains and to research the field. Take the time to criticize twitter ""influencers"". Take the time to reach out to professors, industry professionals and other knowledgeable experts to ask them their thoughts about specific projects and the market as a whole. We desperately need to create a global stage on which there is informed discourse, else this market will never truly grow.",2019-06-28 04:58:18

This hack happened on October 14, 2018. I woke up early in the morning my local time. Right away I turned on the laptop and checked my inbox where I discovered the abnormally large volume of letters from the COSS Exchange. There were a few thousands of them. Each letter informed me about a failed attempt to enter my account on the Exchange.

All the security measures were taken properly:

I received all of the e-mails when I slept. I rushed to check the account and discovered that all my holdings were gone. More specifically, they were sold on low-liquid markets at the rates substantially lower than the market ones.  
[https://monosnap.com/file/ZF2LuWlV5rbwsO6FycUu4mea9ByL2f](https://monosnap.com/file/ZF2LuWlV5rbwsO6FycUu4mea9ByL2f)

In no time I turned to the support of the Exchange and informed about the incident. I wrote about this situation on Reddit and in the public Telegram group of the Exchange. Naturally, the first reaction that I experienced from the community was humiliation and accusations of stupidity. Many called me a dumb fool because I stored funds on the Exchange and so on. No need to point out how I kept the funds. I have what I have now. So on a weekly basis, the Exchange shares the trading fees with the holders of its tokens. The profit is distributed among token holders proportionally to the number of tokens they possess. That's why I decided to keep my tokens with COSS exchange.

The exchange claims:

[https://medium.com/@coss.io/coss-io-october-24th-2018-updates-180ca2bb003b](https://medium.com/@coss.io/coss-io-october-24th-2018-updates-180ca2bb003b)  
[https://monosnap.com/file/bXFU7D1CQamFzrZpi8TRskjqsiW1C2](https://monosnap.com/file/bXFU7D1CQamFzrZpi8TRskjqsiW1C2)

They forgot to mention one small fact that access to my account was received using vulnerability which allowed hacker to perform brute force attack on my 2FA.

I was not the only victim as COSS declares in their medium blog and hacker indeed used exchange’s vulnerability:

They’ve shut down an entire exchange for \~24 hours:  
[https://monosnap.com/file/7AHQbzugClSxUwlx2lHFIpadtxhiqv](https://monosnap.com/file/7AHQbzugClSxUwlx2lHFIpadtxhiqv)

What was that if not an exchange’s vulnerability?

The Exchange claims that the hacker had my password. Of course, the most natural and the easiest thing is to accuse the user of being responsible for the accident. But I can assure you that it is far from being the case. I have been in this industry since the end of 2011, and I do know how to generate and store wallets, passwords etc. I neither use Android smartphones, nor computers with Windows OS. I do not use SMS 2FA. I am meticulous and do not do bullshit. What if it was some internal job? Or users data base leaked? Ok, let's assume that I happened to become a victim/target of a hacker, who somehow managed to access my login and password (what I doubt A LOT). However, I had a 2FA verification installed for this occasion.  
[https://monosnap.com/file/79XrZrCLUTYWyjqRbWpMdbw5sGEi0V](https://monosnap.com/file/79XrZrCLUTYWyjqRbWpMdbw5sGEi0V)

It was designed exactly for the situations like the one I described above. 2FA enables to keep the funds safe even if the password/login was compromised. Recently I received a report from COSS compliance, in which they admitted that the brute force attack took place. After 25,000 trials the attack was successfully completed.  
[https://monosnap.com/file/va2jo4vKoY8BMpCiqVr2lp7AGT8AvO](https://monosnap.com/file/va2jo4vKoY8BMpCiqVr2lp7AGT8AvO)

The hacker got the access to my account and sold all my funds for nothing. After all the Exchange ignores my messages about refund and steps towards that. They’ve only stated amount of assets they were able to recover and  
[https://monosnap.com/file/K53lHFblRaeOLIVt6CUAF3P4tvE2LO](https://monosnap.com/file/K53lHFblRaeOLIVt6CUAF3P4tvE2LO)

claiming that it was the user's (mine) fault that the hacker managed to access the funds.[https://monosnap.com/file/McRLu9kY0vZuSGmVqU3ViDa2IljTkV](https://monosnap.com/file/McRLu9kY0vZuSGmVqU3ViDa2IljTkV)

How come? How would the hacker have accessed the funds if the Exchange had not allowed to perform the brute force attack? Even if it was me who had compromised the password in some magic way, 2FA had to serve the last stand. The hacker managed to brute force it using Exchange’s vulnerability and the Exchange has not stopped the brute force attack. Remember, there were 25,000 trials  
[https://monosnap.com/file/w1OOclQrPSuJFY4GzSpHCHABipfgKa](https://monosnap.com/file/w1OOclQrPSuJFY4GzSpHCHABipfgKa)

If I had additional time, I would manage to respond and prevent the hack. Even if there was my fault, but only 50%, the other half is that exchange gave the opportunity to the hacker to brute force 2FA. In this regard, I publicly call the COSS Exchange to refund me at least 50% of my account's balance.

Assets I had:

\~11 700 000 coss tokens (30kk$ at ATH period)

\~14 BTC

19 000 eos to refund in full (EOS node was down and hacker wasn’t able to withdraw EOS)  
[https://monosnap.com/file/kv0QqQd9nsLszRAJFE5vzJKx8J5aLQ](https://monosnap.com/file/kv0QqQd9nsLszRAJFE5vzJKx8J5aLQ)

\~ 22 ETH

The Exchange should bear the sole responsibility for the accident if its internal vulnerability allowed the hacker to accomplish his/her brute force attack.

If it would be possible to bypass 2FA protection with a brute force attack, every exchange/platform, as well as 2FA providers (generally Google), would be brought into disrepute and would face severe claims from their users. Basically, the whole industry would become a mess. If the case, exchanges/platforms would suffer multi-billion dollar losses, in particular, translating into even more significant losses for the industry as a whole.

No matter what decision COSS exchange will take I call other exchanges to add an extra security feature to protect user’s funds. TRADING PASSWORD. This will prevent anybody to sell user’s assets on the low liquidity markets for cents even if the password was compromised and exchange grants brute force attacks.

Institutional money was never going to jump into crypto at the ATH and make all is little guys rich in the process, that not what they do. They manipulate markets, using the media, and they shake out the weak hands so they can scoop up everything they want for fractions of the price. The shit thing is it's working. Those guys you saw buying lambos and bullshit at the end of last year are the ones who didn't panic sell after the Mt Gox crash thinking ""Atleast I'll come out of this with something"". Look at the volumes at the moment, look at the amount of coins being accumulated right now, who do you think are the ones doing that? You think a bunch of investors with deep pockets just stumbled ass-backwards into the market and don't bother reading the news? Think. If you're selling right now you are selling to rich guys that know something you don't. 

Put the phone down, go an do whatever it was you were doing before crypto for the next month, for the next three months even. Or don't, panic sell to guys that know exactly what they are doing and lament it at the end of the year. We all saw the comments and posts of people warning that after the bull market will come days when everything drops 20% round the board. Well those days are here. No one ever got rich panic selling.  

I'm not frustrated cause my portfolio is dropping, it'll be back. I'm frustrated because all of us little guys have the possibility to ride this wave up because we got here early, and we're dropping like flies at the moment.

Understanding Tether: Why it accounts for a substantial part of the crypto market cap and why its the #1 outstanding issue in crypto markets today,2700,7xae98,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7xae98/understanding_tether_why_it_accounts_for_a/,709,1518566749.0,"In this post I will go in-depth on:

1. How Tether got to be what it is today

2. Why Tether's market cap is a lot more than 0.5% of the total market cap for crypto you see on CoinMarketCap

3. Tether printing timing

4. Tether reserves

5. What could happen to the market if Tether is found to not be backed by reserves

Tether is incredibly important to the cryptocurrency market ecosystem and I've noticed far too few people understand what is going on. 

Very little actual discussion of the 2nd biggest crypto by volume happens here and whenever someone starts a discussion they most often got slapped for ""FUD"". Tether themselves recently hired the major New York based PR firm 5W to spread positive information online and take down critics, I'm sure some of their operatives are probably on Reddit.

But its absolutely critical you understand the risks behind Tether and especially now with the explosion in reserve liability, breakdown in relationship with banks and their auditor and recently announced subpoena. 


#What exactly is Tether and what happened so far?

Tether is a cryptocurrency asset issued by Tether Limited (incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and a sister company of Bitfinex), on top of the Bitcoin blockchain through the Omni Protocol Layer. It is meant to give people a ""stablecoin"", for example a merchant who accepts bitcoin but fears its volatility could shift bitcoin into tether, which can be easier to do than exchanging bitcoin for dollars. Recently they've also added an Ethereum-based ERC20 token. Tether Ltd claims that each one of the tokens issued is backed by actual US dollar (and more recently Euro) reserves. The idea is that when a business partner deposits US dollars in Tether’s bank account, Tether creates a matching amount of tokens and transfers them to that partner, it is NOT a fractional reserve system.

Tether makes the two following key promises in its whitepaper on which the entire premise is build:

> Each tether issued will be backed by the equivalent amount of currency unit (one USDTether equals
one dollar).

>Professional auditors will regularly verify, sign, and publish our underlying bank balance and financial transfer statement.

Tether is centralized and dependent on your trust of Bitfinex/Tether Limited, and that the people behind it are honest people. For the new entrants to this market it will be greatly beneficial understand the timeline of Tether and their connection to Bitfinex.

A brief timeline:

* Bitfinex operators Phil Potter and CFO Giancarlo Devasini set up Tether Limited in the British Virgin Islands, but told the public that Bitfinex and Tether are completely separate. Throughout 2015 and 2016, the amount of Tether stays relatively flat.

* In August 2nd, 2016, the second-largest digital currency exchange heist in history happened, when Bitfinex lost nearly 120,000 bitcoin. Bitfinex never revealed full details of the hack, but BitGo (the security company that had to sign off on the transactions) claims its servers were not breached.  

* Just 4 days after the hack Bitfinex “socializes” its losses from the theft by announcing a 36 percent haircut for almost all of its customers. In return, customers receive BFX tokens, initially valued at $1 each. 

* Two weeks after the hack Bitfinex announces it has hired Ledger Labs, to investigate the theft and perform a financial audit of its cryptocurrency and fiat assets. The public nevers sees the results of the investigation, and months later, Bitfinex admits it never actually hired Ledger Labs to perform an audit to begin with.   

* In May 2017, after long standing calls for an actual audit, Bitfinex hires Friedman LLP to ""complete a comprehensive balance sheet audit.""

* November 7, 2017: Leaked documents dubbed “Paradise Papers” reveal Bitfinex and Tether are run by the same individuals.

* November 19, 2017: Tether is hacked, with 31 million USDT suddenly disappearing. Tether Limited reacts to this by creating a hard fork.

* December 4, 2017: Right after hiring the PR firm 5W to help improve their image, Bitfinex hires law firm Steptoe & Johnson and threatens legal action against critics.

* December 6, 2017 - CFTC issues a subpoena to Tether and Bitfinex. This news isn't made public until the end of January. 

* December 21, 2017 : Without making any formal announcement, Bitfinex appears to suddenly close all new account registrations. Those trying to register for a new account are asked for a mysterious referral code, but no referral code seems to exist.

* After a month of being closed to new registrations, Bitfinex announces it is reopening its doors, but now requires new customers to deposit $10,000 before they can begin trading.

* Friedman LLP completely cut ties with Tether on January 27, 2017.

#Most common misconception: Tether is only a small part of the total market cap

One of the most common misconception people have about cryptocurrencies is that the ""market cap"" amount they see on CoinMarketCap.com is actually the amount of money that is invested in each coin. 

I often hear people online dismiss any issue with tether by simply claiming its not big enough to cause any effect, saying ""Well Tether is only $2.2 billion on CoinMarketCap and the market is 400 billion, its only 0.5% of the market"". 


But this misunderstands what market capitalization for cryptocurrency is, and just how different the market cap for Tether is to every other token. The market cap is simply the last trade price times the circulating supply. It doesn't take into account the order book depth at all. The majority of Bitcoin (and most coins) are held by those who either mined or purchased for a very low price early on and simply held on as very small portions of the total supply was rapidly bid up to their current price.

An increase in market cap of X does NOT represent an inflow of X dollars invested, not even close. A 400 billion dollar market cap for crypto does NOT mean that there is 400 billion dollars underwriting the assets. Meanwhile a 2 billion dollar Tether market cap means there should be exactly $2 billion backing up the asset.

Nobody can tell for sure exactly how much money has been invested in cryptocurrency market, but [analysts from JPMorgan](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-02/jpmorgan-has-some-bad-news-bitcoin-bears) found that there was only net inflow of $6 billion fiat that resulted in $300 billion market cap at the time. This gives us a roughly 50:1 ratio of market cap to fiat inflow.  Prominent crypto evangelist Julian Hosp [gives the following estimate](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/heres-why-market-capitalisation-is-a-bad-way-to-measure-a-cryptocurrencys-value-2018-1): ""For a cryptocurrency to have a market cap of $1 billion, maybe only $50 million actually moved into the cryptocurrency.""

For Tether however the market cap is simply the outstanding supply, 2.2 billion USDT is actually equal to 2.2 billion USD. In order to get $50 USDT you have to deposit $50 real U.S. dollars and then 50 completely new tokens will be issued, which never existed before on the market.

What is also often ignored is that Bitfinex allows margin trading, at a 3.3x leverage. Bitfinexed did an excellent analysis on how tether is entering Bitfinex to fund margin positions

There are $2.2 billion in Tether outstanding and the current market cap of the entire market is $400 billion according to CoinMarketCap. You can actually calculate Tether as a % of total fiat invested in the market according to the JP Morgan estimate, the following table outlines for a scenario of no margin lending and 15/25% of tether being on a 3.3x leverage margin account:

Fiat Inflow/Market Cap Ratio | Tether as % of total market (no margin) | Tether as % of total market (15% on margin) | Tether as % of total market (25% on margin) 
----------|----------------|----------------|----------------
JP Morgan estimate (50:1) | 27.5 % | 36.9 % | 43.3 %

Even without any margin lending Tether is underwriting the worth of about 27.5% of the cryptocurrency market, and if we assume only 25% was leveraged out at 3.3x on margin we have a whole 43% of the market cap being driven by Tether inflow.

A much better indicator on CoinMarketCap of just how influential Tether is actually the volume, i[ts currently the 2nd biggest cryptocurrency by volume](http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/volume/24-hour) and there are even days where its volume exceeds its market cap. 

What this all means is that not only is the market cap for cryptocurrencies drastically overestimating the amount of actual fiat capital that is underwriting those assets, but a **substantial portion of the entire market cap is being derived from the value of Tether's market cap rather than real money**.

Its incredibly important that more new investors realize that Tether isn't a side issue or a minor cog in the machine, but one of the core underlying mechanisms on which the entire market worth is built. **Ensuring that whoever controls this stablecoin is honest and transparent is absolutely critical to the health of the market.**

#Two main concerns with Tether

The primary concerns with Tether can be split into two categories:

1. Tether issuance timing - Does Tether Ltd issue USDT organically or is it timed to stop downward selling pressure? 

2. Reserves - Does Tether Ltd actually have the fiat reserves at a 1:1 ratio, and why is there still no audit or third party guarantee of this?


#Does Tether print USDT to prop up Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?

In the last 3 months the amount of USDT has nearly quadrupled, with nearly a billion being printed in January alone. Some people have found the timing of the most recent batch of Tether as highly suspect because it seemed to coincide with Bitcoin's price being propped up. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/bitfinex-bitcoin-price.html

This was recently analyzed statistically: 

>Author’s opinion - it is highly unlikely that Tether is growing through any organic business process, rather that they are printing in response to market conditions.

>Tether printing moves the market appreciably; 48.8% of BTC’s price rise in the period studied occurred in the two-hour periods following the arrival of 91 different Tether grants to the Bitfinex wallet. 

>Bitfinex withdrawal/deposit statistics are unusual and would give rise to further scrutiny in a typical accounting environment.

https://www.tetherreport.com

I'm still undecided on this and I would love to see more statistical analysis done, because the price of Bitcoin is so volatile while Tether printing only happens in large batches. Simply looking at the Bitcoin price graph over the last 3 months and then the Tether printing its pretty clear there is a relationship but it doesn't seem to hold over longer periods.

Ultimately to me this timing isn't that much of an issue, as long Tether is backed by US dollars. If Bitfinex was timing the prints then it accounts to not much more than an organized pumping scheme, which isn't a fundamental problem. The much more serious concern is whether those buy order are being conducted on the faith of fictitious  dollars that don't exist, regardless of when those buy orders occur.


#Didn't Tether release an audit in September?

Some online posters have recently tried to spread the notion that Tether has actually been audited by Friedman LLP and that a report was released in September 2017. That was actually just a consulting engagement, which you can read here:

https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Final-Tether-Consulting-Report-9-15-17_Redacted.pdf

They clearly state that:

>This engagement does not contemplate tests of accounting records or the performance of other procedures performed in an audit or attest engagement. Our procedures performed are not for the purpose of providing assurance...In addition, our services do not include determination of compliance with laws and regulations in any jurisdiction. 

They state right from the beginning that this is a consultancy job (not an audit), and that its not meant to be assurance to third parties. Doing a consultancy job is just doing a task asked by your customer. In a consultancy job you take information as true from the client, and you have no mandate to verify whether your customer's claims are true or not. The way they checked is simply asking Tether to provide them the information:

>All inquiries made through the consulting process have been directed towards, and the data obtained from, the Client and personnel responsible for maintaining such information.

Tether provided a screenshots of twp bank balances. One of these is in the name of Tether Limited, and while the other is a personal account of an individual who Tether Limited claims has a trust agreement with them:

>As of September 15, 2017, the bank held $60,919,810 in **an account in the name of an in individual for the benefit of Tether Limited**. FLPP obtained an engagement letter for an interim settlement plan between that individual and Tether Limited and that **according to Tether Limited, is the relevant agreement with the trustee. FLLP did not evaluate the substance of the letter and makes no representation about its legality.**

Even worse is that later on in Note 1, they clearly claim that there is no actual evidence that this engagement letter or trust has any legal merit:

>**Note 1: FLLP makes no representations about sufficiency or enforceability of any trust agreement between the trustee and the Client**

Essentially what this is saying is that the trust agreement may not even be worth the paper it’s printed on. 

And most importantly… Note 2:

>“**FLLP did not evaluate the terms of the above bank accounts and makes no representations about the clients ability to access funds from the accounts or whether the funds are committed for purposes other than Tether token redemptions**”

Basically Tether gave them a name of an individual with $60 million in their account according to a screenshot, Tether then gave them a letter saying that there is a trust agreement between this individual and Tether Limited. They also have account with $382 million but no guarantee that this account holds to any lien or other commitments, or that it can be accessed. 

Currently Tether has 2.2 billion USDT outstanding and we have absolutely no idea whether this is actually backed by anything, and the long promised audit is still outstanding.


# What happens if its revealed that Tether doesn't have its US dollar reserves?

According to Thomas Glucksmann, head of business development at Gatecoin: ""If a tether debacle unfolds, it will likely cause quite a devastating ripple effect across many of the exchanges that see most of their volumes traded against the supposedly USD-backed cryptocurrency.""

According to Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at Berkeley: ""You could see a spike in prices in tether-only bitcoin exchanges. So, on those exchanges only you will see a run up in price compared to the bitcoin exchanges that actually work with actually money. So you would see a huge price diverge as people see that only way they can turn tether into real money is to buy other cryptocurrency then move to another exchange. That is a bank run.""

I definitely see the crypto equivalent of a bank run, as people actually try to secure their gains an realize that this money doesn't actually exist within the system:

> If traders lose confidence in it and its value starts to drop, “people will run for the door,” says Carlson, the former Wall Street trader. If Tether can’t meet all its customers’ demand for dollars (and its Terms of Service suggest that in many cases it won’t even try), tether holders will try to snap up other cryptocurrencies instead, temporarily causing prices for those currencies to soar. With tether’s role as an inter-exchange facilitator compromised, investors might lose faith in cryptocurrencies more generally. “At the end of the day, people would be losing substantial sums, and in the long term this would be very bad for cryptocurrencies,” says Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell professor and co-director of its Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts.

>Another concern is that Bitfinex might simply shut down, pocketing the bitcoins it has allegedly been stockpiling. Because people who trade on Bitfinex allow the exchange to hold their money while they speculate, these traders could face substantial losses. “The exchanges are like unregulated banks and could run off with everyone’s money,” says Tony Arcieri, a former Square employee turned entrepreneur trying to build a legally regulated exchange.

https://www.wired.com/story/why-tethers-collapse-would-be-bad-for-cryptocurrencies/

The way I see it, this would be how it plays out if Tether collapses:

1. Tether-enabled exchanges will see a massive spike in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices as everyone leaves Tether. Noobs in these exchanges will think they are now millionaires until they realize they are rich in tethers but poor in dollars.

2. Exchanges that have not integrated Tether will experienced large drops in Bitcoin and alts as experienced investors flee crypto into USD. 

3. There will be a flight of Bitcoin from Tether-integrated exchanges to non-Tether exchanges with fiat off-ramps. Exchanges running small fractional reserves will be exposed, further increasing calls for greater reserves requirements.

4. The exchanges might slam the doors shut on withdrawals.

5. Many exchanges that own large balances of Tether, especially Bitfinex, will likely become insolvent. 

6. There will be lawsuits flying everywhere and with Tether Limited being incorporated on a Carribean Island whose solvency and bankruptcy laws will likely ensure they don't ever get much back. This could take years and potentially push away new investors from entering the space.

#Conclusion

We can't be 100% completely sure that Tether is a scam, but its so laiden with red flags that at this point I would call it the biggest systematic risk in the crypto space. Its bigger than any nation's potential regulatory steps because it cuts right into the issue of trust across the entire ecosystem.

Ultimately Tether is centralizing one of the very core mechanics of the cryptocurrency markets and asking you to trust one party to be the safekeeper, and I really see very little reason to trust Bitfinex given their history of lying and screwing over their own customers. I think that Tether initially started as a legit business to facilitate the ease of moving money and avoiding regulations, but somewhere along the lines greed and/or incompetence took over (something that seems common with Bitfinex's previous actions). Right now we're playing proverbial hot potato, and as long as people believe that Tether is worth a dollar everything is fine, but as some point the Emperor will have to step out from hiding and somebody will point out they have no clothes.

In the long term I really hope once Tether collapses we can move on and get the following two implemented which would greatly improve the market for all investors:

1. Actual USD fiat pairings on the major exchanges for the major currencies

2. Regulatory rules on exchange reserve requirements 

I had watched the Bitconnect people insist for the last 2 years that everything about Bitconnect made perfect sense because they were getting paid daily. The scam works until one day it suddenly doesn't. 

Tether could still come clean and avoid all of this ""FUD"" by simply getting a simple review of their banking, they don't even need a full audit. If everything was legit with Tether, it would be incredibly easy to have a segregated bank account with the funds used solely to back up Tether, then have an third party accounting firm simply review the account and a bank reconciliation statement then spend a few hours in contact with the bank to ensure no outstanding liabilities are held on that balance. This is extremely basic stuff, it would take a few hours to set up and wouldn't take a lot of man-hours for a qualified account to do, and yet they don’t do it. Why? Why hire a major PR firm and spend god knows how much money to pay professional PR representatives to attack ""FUD"" online instead?

I think I know why.

I just want to give everyone a heads up that shits about the get real in so many ways and YOU are here early.  Yes, you, the guy that bought in December and thinks you'll never recover from all your losses.

Let's go over a few of the things we know about.

1.  The top talent in the world are leaving their old tech/finance jobs and entering blockchain.  Everywhere you look, we're seeing this.  From hedge fund managers, to JP Morgan/Goldman Sachs execs, to Google execs.  Gee golly, why are the most talented and intelligent people in the world entering crypto? 

2.  Banks are diving balls deep into crypto (mostly behind the scenes).  First the banks ignored crypto, then they laughed at crypto, then they attacked it by calling it a ""scam.""  Now they're acquiring exchanges (Poloniex), about to open trading desks, investing in projects (Digital Currency Group), and are in a race to get in before their competitors.

3.  Custodial Services: I cannot overstate the importance of this.  As I've written before, Coinbase is going to be at the forefront of mass adoption and are going to play a key role in all of this.  They've recently been hiring INSANE amounts of management positions, engineers, and something around 500 new customer service reps.  This is because they're about to roll out their custodial program where every credit union and some participating major banks are going to offer their crypto index fund to their customers.  Baby boomer (and Gen X) Mom n Dad are going to walk into their local credit union to talk to their financial advisor and he's going to offer them a new product that is extremely volatile, however, got a return of about 1000% last year. He's going to suggest 2-5% of their portfolio would be ok to invest and these coins are going to be insured; They will never have to trade for crypto or make accounts on sketchy exchanges to get them, just gets their broker to buy them like any other financial product.

4.  The demand for OTC crypto is insane.  This is why you see Gemini and Coinbase starting their own Bloc trading services.  Who and why is there so much OTC demand?

5.  Liquidity is about to blow up.  If you don't understand what liquidity does for markets/coin value, do a bit of research.  The exchange union is coming, where the participating exchanges share liquidity.

6.  Because of this future liquidity, traditional securities (company shares, bonds) and commodities will be represented by crypto.  This one's going to take some time, but you can see the writing on the wall here.  This is going to be where crypto is in full-fledged mass adoption-mode. 


Unfortunately back in December/January crypto wasn't quite ready for the explosion that happened. Exchanges had to freeze trading, not allow new sign-ups, not enough service reps, low security on exchanges, and the tech in general wasn't quite ready but things are changing this year, 2018.  Sit back, open a cold one with the boys, make love to your smokin' hot wife, go play catch outside with your kids, and enjoy yourselves because we're about to witness history - And your all a part of it my friends.  Cheers!

Crypto has changed my life in a completely different way…it has made me hungry for knowledge. Cyber, networking, blockchain knowledge.

I use to find myself sitting at my computer desk reading random articles from random websites about every single random blockchain that caught my attention. I would invest in a project.... make a little money, then switch to another project... lose a little money. 

I’m not going to lie…I don’t have what it takes to be a day trader…lesson learned.

However, I kept finding myself hungry for more knowledge. I wanted to know everything about everything.

Finally, one day I was staring at my computer….basically broke and feeling slightly depressed due to a downturn in the market….and decided to do something about it. My old ass went back to school. 

Now I’m proud to say, 4 years later, I have recently finished my Bachelors in Cyber Security, Comptia Sec+ and A+ certs and I even finished up my Associates from when I was 18 and dropped out my final semester. Dumb…I know. But I personally know I would have never decided to take this path without crypto influencing me. 

Next time you find yourself staring at coinmarketcap and the price of your coins, try to find what aspects of these coins excite you (other than the lambos) THEN GO LEARN. See if this is your passion. You don’t even have to go to college. You can find hundreds of learning resources online. Go better yourself and help this community grow.

If crypto somehow implodes tomorrow, will you have anything to show for all the time you have spent staring at your computer/phone screen? Or will it all be screenshots, memories, and what could have beens?

The tribalism is a big problem and will get us nowhere. I don't go around downvoting posts for mentioning coins that aren't in my portfolio... seems like I'm the last guy around that thinks that way.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

&#x200B;

Wow, I did not expect this simple post to resonate with so many people and cause this much discussion. This is a good thing, it shows many of us acknowledge this problem. I also was not trying to single out Vechain or Nano, or delegitimize those projects, they are just the first two offenders that came to mind. I know there are many more cryptocurrency communities that the same can be said for but I won't name names, because that isn't the point of this post.

&#x200B;

Let's do something about this. Don't be that guy/girl, don't downvote a post simply because it references a coin that you don't own or a project that directly competes against one of your big holdings. I get it, the same amount of coins that you hold today are worth maybe 10% of the value that it was in early 2018. I also get that you probably consolidated most of your losses into a few projects, maybe even just one that you are the most confident can come back. Cool, good for you, I hope it works out. But don't censor posts simply because they go against an agenda of pumping your bags. It makes us all look bad and no one just coming into this space is going to want to stick around if this is what they are greeted with. Let's try and learn something new  instead of shouting as loud as we can about our coins and silencing those that disagree with us. This is an exciting time to be alive, we can't allow tunnel vision to get in the way of the big picture here. We are all still early, there is still so much to learn and so much to gain from being in this space right now.",2018-11-14 13:21:28

How and why exchanges are manipulating the price in order to capitalize on the new market dynamics,2362,8aymhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8aymhw/how_and_why_exchanges_are_manipulating_the_price/,487,1523311262.0,"The current market seems to be largely driven not by organic buying and selling, but by exchange driven manipulation of the spot market to exploit the current dynamics of leverage trading. We just saw it again now as they liquidated 3K longs but you [can see this pattern of clear manipulation over and over in the last few weeks ](https://i.imgur.com/LpgnksQ.png).

We have seen several forces set an incentive for exchanges to do this:

* Consistently declining volume - this leads to lower total fee revenue for exchanges, and an incentive to manipulate the price in order to earn revenue through liquidations rather than trading fees.

* Move towards more leveraged positions - both leveraged shorts and leveraged longs are [at or near record levels.](https://i.imgur.com/ljSohM5.png) Shorts especially have gone from 8K outstanding in January to 33K right now, a whole tripling in outstanding positions. 

* Move away from the spot market and towards derivatives - Anybody who has been checking [the combined orderbook](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD) over the last few months has seen Bitmex completely take over the market, while GDAX, Bitfinex, Gemini and others see consistent declines. I've noticed myself an increased interest across the Internet on how derivatives work and anecdotely I have seen more people move away from the HODL meme and towards trading taking high margin bets with a portion of their stack.

Some exchanges like Gemini have reacted to all of this by increasing their trading fees by 400%. Meanwhile Bitfinex specifically seems to be using its hefty weight to manipulate the price in order to capitalize on the record number of people using margin to bet. 

Both longs and shorts are bets on the price moving up or down and they have a ""liquidation price"" at which they get liquidated by the exchange, essentially the exchange gets the entire stack they bet with and extracts a high market fee multiplied by the leverage. Since the exchanges know the characteristics of the outstanding shorts/longs, and since volume is low after these pumps or dumps leading to sideways drift, they can essentially engineer movements in price that create income in terms of liquidations. When there are lots of overleveraged shorts, an exchange can pump the price with bots briefly and collect the short position. Same with longs but in reverse, a quick burst of selling pressure.

You can see this in the most recent pumps too on Bitfinex, where 1K buy orders appear out of nowhere after long sideways movement only to be followed by either sideway movement or slow bleed on pathetic volume:

https://i.imgur.com/3YaWVBI.png

https://i.imgur.com/pvpcd7Z.png

Take a look at the most recent pump up to 7K, it instantanously liquidated about 700 short positions:

https://i.imgur.com/3sCLEB8.png

Now this last dump was a laddered 12.5K sell order on Bitfinex that liquidated around 3K long contracts

https://i.imgur.com/znYyUT8.png

Bitfinex tends to be where the big money traders move (their minimum deposit is 10K) so even if each long position was only 0.5 BTC on average they exchange would make a ton of money. If you look at the BitmexRekt twitter feed that shows a running list of Bitmex liquidations with humorous commetary, [you will see many >$1 million dollar positions being liquidated during these moves.](https://i.imgur.com/fbeJxOT.png)

This is what all the ""Bart"" formations we have seen stem from. Its not George Soros pumping Bitcoin for shits and giggles, nor is it the nebolous ""whales"". They have no incentive to try and pull off PnDs now that it only leads to either sideways movement or decline after the pump. A PnD only works if the delta between the top of the pump end point and dump initiation point is positive, while now it seems to be followed by sideways movement. Those who do want to bet on further upward movements seem to be doing it off the spot market, using margin with futures and perpetuity swaps on Bitmex. This makes the low volume spot market ripe for manipulation, exchanges like Bitfinex and Bitmex have every incentive right now to manipulate the price. 

Looking back it seems almost inevitable that this would have happened, that traders would try to replicate the gains they saw by buying and selling on the spot market a few months ago by using increased leverage and derivatives. In December and January there were days where your holdings would increase by at least 20% no matter what you bought. Once you experience those 20% daily gains you don't want to go back to a market where it slowly bleeds down a few percent every week, so people jumped in on high leverage short positions to multiply their profit on those single percent moves down.

For the small time investor there really isn't much you can do to stop this. This is what being part of an unregulated market means, it means that things like wash trading and long/short liquidation hunting is allowed. 

All you can really do if you're a trader is look at the current ratio of longs vs shorts on Bitfinex and be aware that once short contracts become too high its possible that an exchange may pump the price to profit on it, while if the longs become too dominant we may see a dump.

Edit: Bitfinex, not Bitfenix.

Few months ago I was browsing the net and came across a website (bittrex) that offers cryptocurrency trading, so I did my research and few days later, exactly on 25. June 2017 I bought my first 0.25btc (around 500e back then) and started trading. Ethereum, antshares, litecoin, stratis, waves and so on and so on, I lost few $ on shilled coins but I gained much more on ICOs and altcoin trading.

After few months I was looking at a portfolio of over 5000e without any further investment mostly achieved by the rocket moon of bitcoin and just by doing some turnarounds and daily trades. That was in September 30th and on that day my grandfather has been diagnosed with a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in an early stage where his right side of lungs is affected by a tumour. We're originally from Slovakia so the only option to get this treated was to undergo a surgery to remove the tumour, but considering how bad is the Slovakian healthcare we weren't willing to go forward with this procedure(only procedure covered by his healthcare). The only option was to privately pay for a treatment abroad. After a very long search we found a private clinic that could help us, Oncology clinic in Prague, which was costly but they had the best surgeons to help us.

Few days passed and we received a quote for the treatment. Where the fuck are we going to get 7900e was the next question that went through my mind, my grandparents are on absolutely hilarious Slovakian pension of 420e/month and there was no way they could afford this. My mother couldn't help because her financial situation wasn't any better and then it struck me...Let's take the profits from crypto and use it to pay for the surgery and that's exactly what I did. I cashed out all my crypto and ended up with 6300e on my bank account. Flew to Prague to undergo the initial examination and few weeks later, on 17th of November my granddad had a surgery where the whole right side of his lungs had to be removed due to the spread of the tumour. His weight dropped to 62kg(-18kg in less than two months) and he was having horrendous pains because of the ribs that had to be snapped to access the lungs during the surgery. Everything went good and there were no complications during or after the surgery.

As of today, 18th of December, less than 4 months after he has been diagnosed we received the final results of his progress and cancer stage. No cancerous cells were find anywhere in his body, his lungs are working great, no liver damage and he's now at hom, regaining weight and strenght, all well and healthy, looking forward to spend another few healthy years with his family and loved ones. I know that this fight is probably not over yet as cancer will most likely return at one point, but for now we won and all of this thanks to cryptomarket, without crypto we wouldn't be able to afford this surgery and give him another few years of life to enjoy.",2017-12-19 07:00:15

In the 2008 stock market crash, the S&P 500 went back to the value it had 10 YEARS ago. 

Crypto has been set back 23 days. 

An equivalent 23-day setback on the stock market would mean a drop of about 3%. Can you imagine the news freaking out about a 3% drop? 

I see nothing to worry about, just normal fluctuations in a healthy (but volatile) market. I bet in a few months the market cap will be back to where it was. What can be done and undone in 23 days can  be redone again in 23 days. There's too much overall momentum toward cryptos, even if a 23-day bubble is popping. It's not a 10-year bubble. This is the thing people have to realize. 

Let's imagine, even if (worst case) the whole crypto market cut in half _again_ on top of where we are now, we'd only be set back to late November, about 50 days ago. Internet money is simply useful, and that's not going to change. And we're clearly still at the front(ish) end of the mass adoption curve. These two things are the bedrock of the investment in to cryptocurrencies, and those things haven't changed. 

If you were to panic sell now, I'm guessing in about a couple months you will be regretting it. Almost certainly in a few years you will be regretting it. Imagine cryptos going up another 1000% (which it has, more than once over the years) and you sold because you got cold feet after a 20% movement. A 23-day bubble is not worth being emotional about if you're a long-term investor, which is generally the smartest and lowest-risk way to invest. 

Plus we have no way of knowing how much of this is just one whale getting in and out of the market to create profitable price swings. That can (and probably will) happen again. 

The ocean isn't draining because we're at the low point of a big wave. There will be other waves, and other high points. It's just a matter of patience. As long as the two bedrock principles of why to invest in crypto are still in place (people want internet money, and we are in early adoption phase) I see no reason to sell. ",2018-01-17 17:52:24

Everyone crying about the manipulation is just a fuckin hypocrite. You loved making the money that the unregulated market allowed you to make, but you were too dumb and greedy to know when to exit.

99% of you won't hold through the entirety of the next bull run,2287,bnbdyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/bnbdyi/99_of_you_wont_hold_through_the_entirety_of_the/,819,1557605383.0,"You think you'll hodl, you say you'll hodl, but you won't.

Here's the thing, I don't know shit, and you don't know shit. So, now that we are both level headed, you and I both agree we are shitbrains that don't know what will happen in the market, let's talk about psychology.

When BTC 2x, 3x or 5x, your little peepee will get tingly. The memes will be flowing, you'll be big dick swinging in your 1 bedroom basement apartment in the ""up and coming"" side of town as you check your crypto portfolio multiple times in the middle of the night while people you used to hang out with are out having a good time playing fortnite or whatever the fuck kids are playing these days.

Despite the fact you've already said that you're ""in this for the long haul,"" you're still checking your portfolio like an instagramer stalks people on their timeline.

Why the fuck are you checking prices every 15 minutes still if you're a long term hodler?

The passed10k.gif will come back out of retirement eventually, and you'll be picking colors for your lambo all from your $100 investment into bitshitnect coin.

Then, it will happen. Nobody knows when, but all it takes is a sudden gush of short term traders to sell and wreck your hard hodl'd gains.

You will rush to your favorite shitposting site and blast to the world, ""I was just up 3x, now BTC is down 50% in the last week! What's going on? It's that damn whale again, isn't it!?""

A few people will tell you to keep hodling, ""This is just the beginning,"" they say. But you're smarter than that. You just held through a 3x gain, then lost 50% of those gains. You'll soon get  your confirmation bias from a couple dipshit redditors, ""Derp, 3x gains ain't nothing to sneeze at. Herp, you should have sold then rebought during this correction and you'd have doubled your stack, hurrrr.""

You'll think, ""Wow, your hindsight is absolutely right. Next time it happens, I'll be prepared and I will predict the market with 100% accuracy. I'll say I'm a long term hodler, but I'll keep checking the prices 20 times a day hoping to perfectly time the top and bottom. I'm a very stable genius.""

Then, BTC will have a small bounce up of 15% the next week. You'll find someone that you agree with on Trading View that tells everyone, ""It's going to go retest the shit support at shit level fibonichi 0.69. The pullout method is upon us, there is a 420% chance I'm right, and .007 chance I'm wrong. I'm not your financial adviser, I'm just a guy shilling my ideas hoping I get enough support to influence the market. No collusion!""

You'll sell, the market will bounce back up another 20%, you'll fomo, the market will tank another 50%. You'll sell at another loss, it will drop another 10% and you'll run to reddit, ""I knew it was going to drop, so I sold! I just made 10% more by selling""...but you didn't actually buy yet because you think it's going to drop a little bit further.

You won't tell people you also just got wrecked your previous 4 times doing this and you're down more than 70% during a bull run because you kept trying to time the market.

Of those that are reading this now, my guess is, **at best**, only 1 out of every 100 people will actually DCA or just hodl through the next bull run.

There are going to be multiple, and I'm talking many month long shakeouts along the way to wherever BTC is going.

I don't think 99% of people have the patience and the will to hodl through the gains and the massive selloffs.

You're here now, you've been through a bear market. But, seeing gains is a much different beast. I suspect that once you deal with the 3rd or 4th major shakeout after 3x, 5x, 6x gains, I'm talking truly massive 50-75% selloffs in a few days, that you won't be able to stomach it for long.

Some have $10,000-$50,000 invested down here. Imagine in a year that you have 2x, 3x, or 5x that. Then, you lose 70% of your gains in a week.

This is a real possibility, multiple times. Whether you have $100, $1000, or $50,000 invested down here during the bear market, you need to prepare for that feeling of getting absolutely wrecked in a week.

Some among us are going to have their $20,000 turn into $80,000 or $100,000, then drop to $30,000 or $25,000 in the next 12-18 months.

Imagine this happening multiple times, this 3-6x then losing 70% of those gains, multiple times in a relatively short period of time. Imagine months long consolidation after a sell off, then another shakeout after you were just wishing you would have sold.

It's nice to look at a chart in hindsight and say, ""Zoom out,"" but going through it is a lot more difficult than just looking at the past history from a chart.

You'll be able to hodl through 1 or 2 selloffs, but at some point you're going to be having a stressful week or a stressful month in the next few years. it's going to coincide with a massive selloff and you're going to be sitting there thinking, ""shit, I would have been better off just selling last time. This shit is too stressful.""

For the record, there is nothing wrong with selling at a 2x, 3x, or 5x or whatever you choose, but I remain extremely skeptical that people will actually hodl all the way to the top or near the top of the next bull market, let alone being able to predict when and where that is. Even fewer among us will DCA all the way through and sell at whatever the next top will be.

This is a cruel game, and you won't make it unscathed. Most will fail because of a lack of planning.

Prove me wrong, fellow hodlers and DCAers.

Prove me fucking wrong.

**TL;DR**: Comment based on the title, otherwise read the shit.

*Edit : For the record, I don't know shit, but I do think the top of the next bull market will be $180,000 to $225,000. I have no idea what happens in between now and then. You don't either. And, again, I don't know that it will actually get there, but my spidey senses tell me that. I'd expect it to be around August 2021 and January 2022 though. In a few years. I'll only have about 50% of my stack by that point because I have certain intervals I'm selling because I know I could be wrong; again, I don't know shit so I'm going to sell as I reach certain targets. I'll be DCAing most of the way through, and I'll see you all in crypto hell regardless, you filthy casuals.*",2019-05-12 04:09:43

2017 Taxes - We Need To Get Serious,2257,7nzqky,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7nzqky/2017_taxes_we_need_to_get_serious/,1008,1515060615.0,"I want to make this post a meaningful discussion about American taxes that has three goals:

* **Helping those of us with significant crypto holdings become informed on how to proceed with 2017 taxes**
* **Strengthen our position as legitimate law-abiding citizens**
* **Not holding anyone legally responsible for ""legal advice"" who contributes to this discussion thread** (this is about getting our bearings)

If you are like me you found 2017 to be a very good year for you. I'm not talking to the people who got in on this in early December and made $1,000. I'm talking to those of us who saw our modest yet respectable holding of bitcoins grow to jaw-dropping prices and then continued to diversify our digital portfolio to the point that we may now be holding dozens of currencies traded at various times on a variety of exchanges.

What we are doing is legal and has been legal for years. I am one of those [alleged 802 people who pays their taxes on Coinbase](http://fortune.com/2017/03/19/irs-bitcoin-lawsuit/). And let me tell you, the professional accounting firm I use to pay my taxes charged me a pretty penny for basically knowing the one thing everyone does know about cryptocurrency - that [you have to pay long-term capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies you've held for over a year and sold for American dollars](https://bitcoin.tax/blog/bitcoin-taxes-common-questions/). So that's what I've been doing and I've been doing that with each bitcoin being considered at 100% profit because I bought all my bitcoins from Mt. Gox! Maybe you've never payed taxes on all the bitcoin you sold but let's face it - in 2017 you better pay your taxes and you better know what you're talking about and doing. A lot of us have found ourselves with serious money that we did not have until 2017.

The real problem comes from the variety of exchanges we've joined and the amount of trading of currencies on these exchanges. Many of these exchanges are also not illegal to use. While Bitcoin has been on the IRS radar for a while these exchanges specialize in something that has never been truly significant enough to get the IRS's full attention until 2017. But this problem is multi-faceted:

* **In 2017, was exchanging one crypto for another crypto considered a taxable event?** - [The fact is there isn't a clear answer on this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2017/12/28/loophole-allows-tax-free-bitcoin-exchanges-into-2018/#4f50d7b312fa). With the IRS tying cryptocurrencies down as property (rather than currencies which- as I understand it- wouldn't be taxed) they allowed the loophole of the 1031 which allows swaps for like-kind properties. The IRS called cryptos properties, people are swapping cryptos with each other (literally) while small fees are charged for using the network or exchange, and thus - it could be argued that all exchanges *between* cryptos are NOT a taxable event. I personally like this idea but I clearly have a bias. There are many other people who claim that all cryptocurrency transactions between each other are taxable and this comes with its own bag of worms. And indeed, the rock-star new Republican tax code does mirror this sentiment by solely claiming 1031 use for Real Estate. So this leaves us with another question:

* **What legal stance should we take when talking with our accountants/ doing our taxes?** The stunning impossibility of what is expected of us LEGAL citizens doing LEGAL trading in order to report on our taxes, if we do take the stance that all crypto transactions are taxable, is so highly complex that it's almost like the IRS is forcing all crypto-traders into an illegal space. In a sense they are trip-wiring the entire crypto market with expectations that are impossible to follow. We must have some legal rights here or at least legal stances that we can take when dealing with such a new fast paced market and such a slowly-responding vaguely-directed bureaucracy like the IRS. In [one of the better crypto tax threads on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7m56g0/the_absolute_fucking_impossibility_of_reporting/) one person expressed with acute detail the amount of problems recording all of our transactions really are based on the current IRS expectations which are vague and the IRS is not giving a clear answer on whether cryptos are allowed to be considered exempted using 1031. Even if they were there still is expected a way to report everything. My accountant will want to do whatever is safest for them and likely the most expensive for me. How do I ensure a reasonable approach is taken by my tax professional that considers my needs and not just throwing as much money at the IRS as possible? I want to pay my taxes but I want tax laws to be fair on crypto, which leaves me to my next point:

* **What is the best way to look at crypto from a tax point of view?** Currently cryptocurrency is a square peg in a round hole. The IRS, clearly unprepared (as we all were) for the massive attention and growth of cryptocurrency in 2017 was already stuffed into the the ""property"" hole despite being developed and created for *much more* than that. Cryptocurrency - whether you want to call it an asset or a currency - is already billions of dollars deep in projects that are meant to change the way entire systems operate *on a global scale*! This is a global thing taking place within  different countries. We already pay capital gains taxes or income taxes when we exchange them into dollars which is a fair and easily reliable system to document - is it even right for the IRS to tax more? While there may be some in here who believe nobody should be paying taxes with cryptos I think that cryptos (like everything else) should have some taxable responsibility- but not so much that it becomes highly burdensome and a legal minefield allowing the IRS specter to be chasing you for alleged misdoings years down the line. And if crypto is as successful as its going to be there will likely be less of a reason to exchange into dollars anymore thus losing the leverage of the capital gains/income tax. And looking into the short term future decentralized exchanges are even going to be set up potentially removing the ability to track cryptos in any form whatever! What is the appropriate way to tax crypto basing it on the fact that it IS crypto and not necessarily merely ""property"" or ""currency""?

* **What level of responsibility do exchanges play in 2017 taxes?** Being a proud Coinbase tax payer I had the privilege of giving my tax accountant a printed out piece of paper with a terrible excel sheet on it that displayed my yearly bitcoin transactions and told them that this was the best document they were going to get. I haven't gotten the information from Coinbase this year yet, and hopefully they've improved the quality of the report but  *at least there is one*. I just tried looking for how to get the information from Bittrex and while it may be available it wasn't easy to find with a google-search or on their website. **That** is a problem. This is an exchange that is legally allowed to operate in the United States. I could sign up to Bitcoin.tax to find out the information allegedly but I really should not have to sign up to anywhere to find out how to get my annual tax document from my exchange. And if they don't provide one then why is the United States legally allowing them to operate within their borders? If the IRS decides to take their records two years down the line like they did in 2017 with Coinbase and they come to us asking us why we didn't report something and it was because there was no easy/possible way to obtain the records from the users end, how can that be our fault? It would be great if there was a sticky-noted thread on ANY of these crypto boards on how to obtain a document of the year's transactions from every one of the exchanges out there because many of us need them. There is an expectation that we are supposed to calculate the amount gained from when we first purchased a currency to when we traded it for another currency. Aside from the fact that even if we are provided an annual report document it won't be in dollars - it will be in BTC or ETH or USDT or some other pairing at a specific time with a specific amount in those pairings on that specific exchange. The dollar correlation that's needed - if not provided - makes reporting crypto transactions nearly impossible.

* **How are we supposed to accommodate for transactions to and from wallets?** Say we can do all of those things above but now we move it to a private wallet for safekeeping. From there we might send it to another wallet as it intermingles with other coins and from there they are traded on other exchanges. What is the dollar correlation there? What is the appropriate gains? Which exchange did you buy *that specific coin* from? This all matters for taxes but almost impossible to track between wallets and exchanges. If it can't be done, how can we be held accountable to do it? If we can't do it, then what legal ground do we have to say what is being expected is byzantine and unrealistic? Also, it's my understanding that we don't need to report coins in private wallets but that'll be nearly impossible not to do if we have to do all this tracking.

* **Who specializes in cryptocurrency?** - Maybe we can't find all the answers here but some of you out there must be able to point us in the direction of someone that can give us answers. I'm not talking about the conservative tax lawyer that's going to make sure you pay every last dime in a way that would make the IRS want them to be the new head of the department - and I'm not talking about the shady guy who promises that you can get out of paying a dime. I'm talking professionals that aren't just going to be pushed over and know their stuff on this topic. I will gladly pay for this legal muscle to ensure I am legally participating in our society through crypto transactions while not just trying to tax me every time I click the mouse.

Some people say just to ignore all of this tax mess because the IRS is likely to change their stance 10 more times. But I don't want to ignore it because cryptocurrency is already seen as a shady business. And it's not - it's a globally disruptive technology that provides benefits many centralized systems can't and it's the reason why it's busting through the $700 billion market cap at the beginning of 2018. Please, let's organize and approach our taxes honestly and in an informed fashion this year. The fact is many of us in the crypto community visit crypto subreddits and together - with a similar mentality, attitude, drive, and direction- we can influence the crypto policy to be fair to both the country and the crypto-trader.

Ignore news designed to get your attention and to promote fear.
America never suppresses Innovation.
Innovations start and flourish in America.
==========
When they (the banks and recent crackdown on customers) fear you, they try to suppress you. But wait, innovation always wins.
==========

Highlights from tomorrow's testimony from Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman-

1. ""These warnings are not an effort to undermine the fostering of innovation through our capital markets –**America was built on the ingenuity, vision and spirit of entrepreneurs who tackled old and new problems in new, innovative ways**. Rather, they are meant to educate Main Street investors that many promoters of ICOs and cryptocurrencies are not complying with our
securities laws and, as a result, the risks are significant.""

2. ""Through the years, technological innovations have improved our markets, including through increased competition, lower barriers to entry and decreased costs for market participants. **Distributed ledger and other emerging technologies have the potential to further influence and improve the capital markets and the financial services industry**. Businesses, especially smaller businesses without efficient access to traditional capital markets, can be aided by financial technology in raising capital to establish and finance their operations, thereby allowing them to be more competitive both domestically and globally. And these technological innovations can provide investors with new opportunities to offer support and capital to novel concepts and ideas.""

3. ""Said simply,**we should embrace the pursuit of technological advancement, as well as new and innovative techniques for capital raising**, but not at the expense of the principles undermining our well-founded and proven approach to protecting investors and
markets.""

==================================================================================
Highlights from Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman

1. ""Traditionally, there has been a need for a trusted intermediary – for example a bank or other financial institution – to serve as a gatekeeper for transactions and many economic activities. **Virtual currencies seek to replace the need for a central authority or intermediary with a decentralized, rules-based and open consensus mechanism.  An array of thoughtful business, technology, academic, and policy leaders have extrapolated some of the possible impacts that derive from such an innovation, including how market participants conduct transactions, transfer ownership, and power peer-to-peer applications and economic systems.**""

2. ""...In fact, virtual currencies may be all things to all people: **for some, potential riches, the next big thing, a technological revolution, and an exorable value proposition; for others, a fraud, a new form of temptation and allure, and a way to separate the unsuspecting from their money.**""

3. ""The CFTC and SEC, along with other federal and state regulators and criminal authorities, will continue to work together to bring transparency and integrity to these markets and, importantly, **to deter and prosecute fraud and abuse**. These markets are new, evolving and international. As such **they require us to be nimble and forward-looking**; coordinated with our state, federal and
international colleagues; and engaged with important stakeholders, including Congress.""

4. ""**We are entering a new digital era in world financial markets. As we saw with the development of the Internet, we cannot put the technology genie back in the bottle. Virtual currencies mark a paradigm shift in how we think about payments, traditional financial processes, and engaging in economic activity. Ignoring these developments will not make them go away, nor is it a responsible regulatory response. The evolution of these assets, their volatility, and the interest they attract from a rising global millennial population demand serious examination.**""

5. ""**With the proper balance of sound policy, regulatory oversight and private sector innovation, new technologies will allow American markets to evolve in responsible ways and continue to grow our economy and increase prosperity. This hearing is an important part of finding that balance.**""

I don't have to justify myself to interwebz people but there has been nothing but long term hold and investments. if I was stupid enough to perform illicit activity with my coinbase account or other wallets... Would I really be posting about it here?**


Original Post:

I would like to start out by saying I really wish I did not have to do this, however given the circumstances I am exhausting all my options.  I apologize for the length but I need to get this out there as it maybe will help others make informed decisions about which exchanges to use. 

 I setup and fully verified a Coinbase account towards the later half of 2017. I was able to make successful ACH transfers into my USD Wallet and subsequently purchase thousands of dollars of crypto. I also had zero issues with credit card purchases. Other than not being able to get verified on GDAX so far so good. 
Fast forward to early January 2018. I decided to convert more Fiat into Crypto so I did a combination of wire and ACH transfer to what amounted to $16,000 USD. I waited for my respective coin to hit my re-buy point and went to make a large purchase only to be greeted by an error telling me that I needed to verify my SSN. This is very strange considering I had been fully verified with no issues purchasing before. Okay no problem - I enter my information which includes basics such as full name, address, SSN, occupation, etc. For whatever reason this fails along with several other attempts with varying aspects of information. After several failed attempts it locks me out for 24 hours. Over the next few days I rinse and repeat the process of varying my information and getting locked out for 24 hours. 

After around 100 failed attempts it was evident to me that no combination of my information would work. On Jan. 17 I decided to call the 800 number and speak directly to customer service. The lady I spoke with was friendly and seemed to understand as I walked her through the issue. After I had convinced her I had exhausted every possible combination of my information she recommended that I get referred to a ""specialist"" who would be able to immediately correct this issue. She said that in order to escalate the case number she would need to send me an email explaining common solutions for failed ID quiz (we already covered on the phone) as a formality and I would only need to reply back saying that I have already attempted the common solutions. Once I replied back she would be able to forward to a ""specialist"" and escalate to a ""priority 10"". Naturally I replied to the email immediately asking for this to be addressed. Here is the response I received: 

*""Hi there,
I’m sorry to hear that you are still having difficulty verifying your ID through the quiz. As I mentioned we use a third party to facilitate the quiz, and sometimes they just don’t have enough or up-to-date information.
If you’ve tried several times and still can’t successfully complete the quiz, unfortunately there may just not be enough information to verify you at this time.
You are welcome to continue trying to take the quiz as often as you’d like (there is a limit to the number of times you can try per day), as it is possible that the information may update and you could pass. You may also want to try entering different variations of your address, as that is one of the most common causes of not passing the quiz.
In some cases, this verification may be required to continue purchasing through Coinbase. However, in many cases it is not required, and you should still be able to purchase digital currency up to your daily limit with an unverified account as well as use many of Coinbase’s features for buying, selling and transferring digital currency.
In the future we may be able to implement a different method for verifying identity, but at this time we cannot manually verify your ID.
Again I’m sorry for the difficulty with the quiz. Thank you for using Coinbase.""*


WTF??? This is completely opposite of what the lady on the phone told me. Did she just tell me this to get me off the phone and now they send me an email saying ""we can't help you""? What do you mean you can't help me... you have $16,000 of my money. I immediately call back and speak to another operator asking what the deal was. She reassured me that the case was going to a ""specialist"" and would be a ""priority 10"" and sends me an email saying she is working with a specialist to address it properly. Obviously I am very perturbed at this point, however I let cooler heads prevail and try a few more days of entering my information. Of course this lead to zero success. 

I wait until Jan 24th and call back into the the 800 number to speak with an agent. After I politely explained the situation to the phone agent lo and behold they refer me to a ""specialist"" as the phone agent is unable to do anything other than verify I have a case open and it's a ""priority 10"". Before I let them hang up the phone on me and send me another email saying it's being looked at I ask if there is a way for the agent to look at the que and give me an estimate of when this will be resolved. Naturally there is no que or case# tracking system according to the agent. I also ask if I can have a number to speak with a specialist direct -- ""No you cannot speak with them"". What about email directly to a specialist? - ""No you cannot do that either"".  Can you call the specialist and speak with them? ""No we cannot do that"".  Can you call the specialist and conference me in with them? ""No we cannot do that either"". Okay so we are back to the wait for a specialist routine. The agent doubly reassures me that it will be resolved as fast as it possibly can because it is a ""priority 10"" so I reluctantly hang up the phone as it appears there is no other option. 

My mentality at this point was to call back in every day so I call back in on the 25th and essentially have a mirror image of the conversation from the 24th. At this point I realize this is going nowhere so I decide I will transfer my money back into my bank account and move to another exchange. I log into coinbase to make the transfer and WTF?!?! I can't transfer my money back into my account it came from without verifying my SSN and other information. Surely this is a joke that I have to have my SSN verified to move my own money back into the exact account it came from. At this point my mentality has moved beyond FOMO coin mania and into territory of - they have a decent amount of my money and I don't know if I will be able to get it back. 

It took every ounce of strength but I decided to take a zen-like approach and give it some more time. Absolutely zero correspondence or change in status on my Coinbase account over the next 2 weeks. On Feb 9 I made the decision to call in and make one last attempt and if the results are the same I would close my account live over the phone. The agent I spoke with gave me the same pitch of already being escalated to a ""specialist"" and there was nothing he could do further.  I really went to town and explored all options so fun facts I learned from that conversation: 1) The agent and specialist do not communicate directly 2) Apparently there is no governing authority over either of these entity's that bridges to two 3) you cannot speak with anyone above the agent, not even a supervisor? 4) You can't communicate with a specialist - but we already knew that one. 5) Specialists ""DO EXIST"" 6) the phone agent cannot view if your case has been looked at or give you an estimate of when it will be completed.  7) A phone agent will ""put you on hold"" to pretend like they are speaking with someone (not a specialist) in order to appease you into believing they are doing something constructive towards a resolution. 

 Clearly this is not getting resolved and the whole phone agent schtick is a lost cause. I immedately requested that my account be terminated and my money returned to me. I was greeted with the following ""Sir, you cannot close your account until you transfer all of your money out of your coinbase account"" Let that sink in for a moment. I cannot buy crypto, sell crypto, or transfer any USD until my SSN is verified. My SSN and information cannot be verified through the normal Coinbase verification and there is no manual way to do it nor will they provide any live customer support to work towards a resolution. I cannot close my account until all my money is transferred and there are no alternative ways to transfer money out of a Coinbase account. WHAT IN THE ACTUAL F!@#$. 

Coinbase literally has my $16,000 USD held hostage as there is no solution other than ""wait for a specialist who may or may not be a real thing other than what we tell you to get you off the phone"".  I had a fully verified and functioning account - this is not an error on my end or me being pissy because I couldn't buy coin at the right time. They knowingly took $16,000 USD and then removed my verification status, have provided zero evidence of a solution, and then deny me when I make a move to close my account. I would have to believe that there are legal boundaries being crossed by denying me to close my account. I can look past the FOMO and the untold loss potential on having this amount of capital gridlocked but I cannot forgive them not even allowing me to close my account. I could even possibly make amends with this entire situation if I felt that I was receiving customer support that built trust they were actually looking for a resolution and not just telling me whatever to get me off the phone. Who knows what's really going on behind the scenes. 

My biggest problem with all of this - Coinbase certainly had ZERO issue taking the USD incoming but when it comes to the reverse its a big FU. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? Recommendations? I have thought about contacting a lawyer and seeing what my options are. I also contemplated going to appropriate US authoritative bodies but I really would prefer to not bring negative attention to crypto.

# Brave Introduces Beta of Private Tabs with Tor for Enhanced Privacy while Browsing

Today we’re releasing our latest desktop browser [Brave 0.23](https://brave.com/download/) which features Private Tabs with [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), a technology for defending against network surveillance. This new functionality, currently in beta, integrates Tor into the browser and gives users a new browsing mode that helps protect their privacy not only on device but over the network. Private Tabs with Tor help protect Brave users from ISPs (Internet Service Providers), guest Wi-Fi providers, and visited sites that may be watching their Internet connection or even tracking and collecting IP addresses, a device’s Internet identifier.

Private Tabs with Tor are easily accessible from the File menu by clicking New Private Tab with Tor. The integration of Tor into the Brave browser makes enhanced privacy protection conveniently accessible to any Brave user directly within the browser. At any point in time, a user can have one or more regular tabs, session tabs, private tabs, and Private Tabs with Tor open.

The Brave browser already automatically blocks ads, trackers, cryptocurrency mining scripts, and other threats in order to protect users’ privacy and security, and Brave’s regular private tabs do not save a user’s browsing history or cookies. Private Tabs with Tor improve user privacy in several ways. It makes it more difficult for anyone in the path of the user’s Internet connection (ISPs, employers, or guest Wi-Fi providers such as coffee shops or hotels) to track which websites a user visits. Also, web destinations can no longer easily identify or track a user arriving via Brave’s Private Tabs with Tor by means of their IP address. Users can learn more about how the Tor network works by watching this [video](https://youtu.be/JWII85UlzKw).

Private Tabs with Tor default to [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) as the search engine, but users have the option to switch to one of Brave’s other nineteen search providers. DuckDuckGo does not ever collect or share users’ personal information, and welcomes anonymous users without impacting their search experience — unlike Google which challenges anonymous users to prove they are human and makes their search less seamless.

In addition, Brave is contributing back to the Tor network by running Tor [relays](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html). We are proud to be adding bandwidth to the Tor network, and intend to add more bandwidth in the coming months. Our relays can be viewed at: [https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/family:FBC2856A48705F3ED17E504F8FC89EC6433ED25D](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/family:FBC2856A48705F3ED17E504F8FC89EC6433ED25D)

Since Brave’s implementation of Private Tabs with Tor is currently in beta, there are still some known issues and [leaks](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+org%3Abrave+label%3Ator%2Fleakproofing&type=Issues)which we intend to fix in future versions. We welcome developer contributions to our Private Tabs with Tor feature via [GitHub](https://github.com/brave), and look forward to releasing updated versions in the coming weeks. We also plan to include support to choose exit node geolocation in the future. For users who currently require leakproof privacy, we recommend using the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en), which provides much stronger and well-tested protection against websites or eavesdroppers using advanced techniques to uncover a true IP address.

We’re excited about providing our users with a new way to protect the privacy of their browsing habits, especially as more sites and advertisers are using tracking techniques and abusing user trust. Our user-first approach aims to standardize a privacy-by-default model that gives users ownership of their data and online experience, and Tor integration via Private Tabs vastly contributes to our platform.

Note: In addition to Private Tabs with Tor, Brave 0.23 features an updated icon set, refinements to the primary toolbar styling and dimensions, adjustments for tab previews, and usability improvements in the title-mode feature of the URL bar. Brave 0.23 also includes improved compatibility with Google’s suite of productivity tools, which now work better with Brave’s default Shield settings.",2018-06-29 08:54:35

We got a new P.O.S since then and haven't set up any way to receive bitcoin. Last night however, someone came in who remembered all the hype and asked me if he could pay with Bitcoin. Said it was on ""his bucket list"". I told him he was in luck. I had him send it to me and I just paid cash into the register.

After the transaction, which we were both pretty amped about as I've never received crypto in the wild and he had never sent it, I told my boss what happened and he immediately told me I was in charge of making sure we can accept Bitcoin going forward.

Right now, most people think we're just a bunch of kids that use cryptos to buy drugs. So with sentiments like this showing up, we look like immature dumbasses. We are setting the wrong example when other people browse through and what they see is that we're busy making fun of people losing money

I started participating when the Sub was a lot smaller and didn't see much of this before. So chances are it's a lot of you that are new here that are resorting to this behavior. So stop behaving like it's your baby and other newcomers are just suckers. Congratulate them on the investment and help them ride the tide. We're still in the early stages.

I'm kindly asking to knock it off. Whether you like it or not, we're being watched and judged for shit like this.

EDIT: To those of you trying to educate me that this is normal shit in Crypto, yes I know that and I'm not freaking out here. What I'm saying is that for people who just got in the game and haven't seen this volatility before, it's gonna be hell. It's a big drop at 50%. Those kinds of numbers during 2008 made people kill themselves. I'm not trying to be the thought police here, I believe in freedom of speech...I'm just asking to be more considerate in what's posted on here, use your right wisely. You never know if someone who's lost big reads this and you bring him/her down even more.

EDIT 2: thanks u/Conflixx for putting my point into better context than I did myself :)

> The point of OP though is the fact that it seems like new people who just started with cryptocurrencies, as did I just start about 5-6 mo ths ago, are making fun of people who only just jumped the gun at it's ATH right before the market crashed. People who started when I did probably more then doubled their investment because of the amazing december bull run, those are the guys who're posting this bullshit all the time now. I tend to stay away from those memes, I mean.... You might just push someone over the edge to kill himself because he basically got himself into trouble by investing to much money. I sure as hell don't want anything to do with that. Even if it's only just a slight possibility, that's a big no-no for me.",2018-02-02 14:55:47

[Full blog post with all the tables](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-two-years-2018-2-xxromn)

tl;dr - Thanks to some good news out of China, October produced gains which snapped a three month losing streak. $1000 investment in Top Ten cryptos on January 1st, 2018 is now worth about $192. **Bitcoin** maintains overall leader position followed by **Litecoin** then **Ethereum.**  Take the two Top Ten experiments together, I'm down -21%.

\*\*NOTE\*\* - I usually like to release the two posts a day apart, but I'll be spacing out the Top Ten 2018 and the Top Ten 2019 reports a bit more as readers have mentioned they've been removed by the mods (no offence taken, mods - the content is quite similar, I assume the posts are being removed because they're seen as  identical. \*\*END NOTE\*\*

# The Experiment:

Instead of hypothetically tracking cryptos, I made an actual $1000 investment, $100 in each of the Top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap as of the 1st of January 2018. Think of it as a lazy man's Index Fund (no weighting or rebalancing), less technical, more fun (for me at least), and hopefully still a proxy for the market as a whole - or at the very least an interesting snapshot of the 2018/2019 crypto space. I’m trying to keep it simple and accessible for beginners and those looking to get into crypto but maybe not quite ready to jump in yet.

I have also started a [parallel project:](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-2019-month-nine-xyqkqe) on January 1st, 2019, I repeated the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) into the new Top Ten cryptos as of January 1st *2019*. Spoiler alert: the 2019 Experiment makes for much happier reading.

# The Rules:

Buy $100 of each the Top 10 cryptocurrencies on January 1st, 2018. Run the experiment two years. Hold only. No selling. No trading. Report monthly. Compare loosely to the [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-2019-month-nine-xyqkqe).

# Month Twenty-Two - Down 81%

Thanks to some positive news out of China, October decisively broke a three month losing streak for the 2018 Top Ten portfolio. All cryptos in the experiment were either up or flat this month, a welcome change from summer's downward trend.

# Ranking and October Winners and Losers

Although the market as a whole gained, a few of our 2018 Top Ten coins had trouble keeping up. **IOTA** and **NEM** each dropped two places to #18 and #27, respectively. **Dash** slid three slots, and now teeters on the edge of the Top Twenty. On the positive side **Bitcoin Cash** gained one position in the rankings, climbing to the four spot.

*October Winners* \- **Bitcoin Cash** rebounded nicely after a dismal September finishing +29% up on the month. **Ripple** and **Stellar** had solid months as well, ending October at +16% and +14% respectively.

*October Losers* \- Only **IOTA** lost value this month, down -1%. Along with **NEM** and **Dash**, the three were basically flat in October.

For those keeping score, here is tally of which coins have the most monthly wins and loses during the first 22 months of this experiment. Most monthly wins (5): **Bitcoin**. Most monthly loses (5): **Stellar**. All cryptos have at least one monthly win. The only two coins never to lose a month? **Bitcoin** and **Dash**.

# Overall update – Bitcoin far ahead of peers. Four worst performers down over -90% each, NEM still in basement.

**Bitcoin** is still miles ahead of the pack maintaining a *40+ percentage point lead* over second place **Litecoin** and third place **Ethereum**. This isn't even the widest lead **Bitcoin** has held since I started the experiment nearly two years ago: August 2019's +50% lead is still the record.

Looking through my past reports, poor **NEM** has been stuck in the basement all year. Since January 2019 is has been the experiment's worst overall performer. **NEM** is currently down -96% followed by **Cardano**, **Dash**, and **IOTA** all down over -90% since January 1st, 2018. My initial $100 investment in **NEM** is worth just $4.49.

40% of the cryptos that started 2018 in the Top Ten have dropped out, specifically **NEM, Dash, IOTA**, and **Cardano**. They have been replaced by **EOS, Binance Coin, Tether,** and **BTCSV**.

# Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

Breaking a three month losing streak, crypto ended October in positive territory, up about +$26B by month's end. The overall market cap is sitting around the $248B mark, rebounding to September 2019 levels. Since January 2018, the total market cap is down -57%.

If you're looking for a silver lining, followers of my [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-2019-month-nine-xyqkqe) will note that there has been an increase of +74% in total crypto market cap since the beginning 2019.

# Bitcoin dominance:

**Bitcoin** dominance ticked down slightly in October, but no major shift from last month. For context, the range since the beginning of the experiment in January 2018 has been quite wide: a high of 70% in September 2019 and a low of 33% in February 2018.

# Overall return on investment from January 1st, 2018:

After three straight months of loses, the portfolio gained a modest $17 in October. If I cashed out today, my $1000 initial investment would return $192, down nearly -81%.

The 2019 Top Ten Experiment is doing a bit better. If I cashed that experiment out today, that $1,000 initial investment would return $1,387, a +39% gain. Full October report to come.

Taken together, here's the bottom bottom line: **after a $2000 investment in both the 2018 and the 2019 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, my portfolios would be worth $1,579.**

That's down about -21%.

# Implications/Observations:

As always, the experiment's focus of solely holding the Top Ten Cryptos continues to be a losing approach. While the overall market is down -%57 from January 2018, the cryptos that began 2018 in the Top Ten are down **-81%** over the same period.

At no point in this experiment has this investment strategy been successful: the initial 2018 Top Ten have under-performed each of the twenty-two months compared to the market overall.

I'm also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options. The S&P 500 is now up +15.2% since the beginning of 2018. My initial $1k investment into crypto would have yielded about +$152 had it been redirected to the S&P.

# Conclusion:

Thanks to the news out of China, October ended up breaking the streak of three consecutive months of downward movement for crypto. Again, this shows that unpredictability is the norm in crypto: we seemed on track to continue the downward trend until the end of the year. With two months left in the year, will the October gains hold?

Thanks for reading and for supporting the experiment. I hope you’ve found it helpful. I continue to be committed to seeing this process through and reporting along the way.

I strongly believe a great deal of these ""news"" articles have been brigaded or vote-manipulated.

""Russia investing in bitcoin = fake news."" Absolutely, I do not disagree with that. Taking a completely non-influential Russian's political beliefs on Twitter and spinning a news article on it - that's some bull shit. Conflicting articles on the legality of cryptocurrency in India, this is all dog shit.

If cryptocurrency is to be taken seriously, if it is to be the ""way of the future"", then its advent would only be accelerated by destroying websites that are profiting off of the fringes of the success of cryptocurrency. 

EDIT: If a political figure, political body, celebrity, or well-known entrepreneur / business owner (Elon Musk, Winklevoss Twins, a state senator, a massive city's mayor, a country's president, etc.) have something to say, usually they'll say it on Twitter and it's better for us to see what they say there than read some news source that's going to make 1000 words out of what these public figures can say in 280 characters on social media.

EDIT 2: While I won't list any specific articles, I suppose **some, purely 100% speculative** articles would be just fine. For example, if someone maintains a blog on Medium and investigates the topic of a particular bitcoin ETF, or if someone runs a wordpress blog and entertains the idea of banks offering cryptocurrency custody solutions, or if somebody cites real sources from real people without trying to jump to B.S. conclusions, I'm all for it!

"The FCC is expected to announce a vote to gut net neutrality rules the day before Thanksgiving. Only a big burst of phone calls to Congress can stop them from allowing ISPs to charge extra fees to access sites, apps, and send cryptocurrency. This is a direct threat to the growth of the cryptomarket.",1959,77g1kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/77g1kc/the_fcc_is_expected_to_announce_a_vote_to_gut_net/,361,1508463651.0,"Hey everyone, **the chairman of the FCC, is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd.** Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services.

These changes could severely stifle growth in the still-developing cryptomarket. With touchy topics like money laundering, darknet markets, and anonymous coins like Monero, we could see ISPs blocking or heavily throttling cryptocurreny transactions in the near future.

**[But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.

To reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.

When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: 
> I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

1. Talks were superficial, and they didn’t seem to know who their audience was. Sorry folks, normies are gone. Speak to your core enthusiasts.    

2. The whole presentation vibe was, let’s bend over backward for bankers and discuss how we’re going to do it. I get that it’s in nyc, but come on. If the suits are here, let’s discuss using their money to lobby congress in favor of crypto instead of shorting the market.    

3. Presenters rehashed cliche after cliche, “muh 90% of icos will fail.” Instead of delving into the fundamental problems facing crypto (real world usage by the average joe, scalability, centralization).    

Not to mention how disorganized everything was.

I'm in the US. I day-trade cryptocurrencies and have made tens of thousands of orders across many pairs and exchanges (and have made substantially more than I would have by just ""hodl xd"", even with short-term penalty added, thank you very much). Uncle Sam wants his pie. Okay, fine. I know exactly how much I've made by simply tallying the deposits and withdrawals from by bank to my fiat gateways, and I'm willing to be taxed on that, but...

The IRS expects me to report every single transaction on a form *with each interval gain and loss step reported in USD*. Every single one of my tens of thousands of orders and partial trades, most of which having no actual valuation or realization in USD, yet somehow I'm expected to calculate the imaginary USD gain/loss of each when BTC/USD fluctuates by whole percents every other minute on the reference fiat exchange (GDAX, say). No matter what painstaking diligence is paid to reporting the notional USD gain/loss for every alt pair and perpetual swap trade by cross-referencing those irrelevant data points, **I will inevitably end up with a totally fictional sequence of numbers that deviates significantly from my known, actual USD gain from what hit my fucking bank and what is presently on my exchange accounts.** This especially when transaction and trading and funding fees are taken into account, as well as the nightmare of slippage and partial fills.

Also Bittrex completely wiped out my trade history, and everyone else's from what I hear, but my deposits/withdrawals are still there and that should really be all that matters (but not to the IRS apparently). I also had a stint on poswallet.com, same situation.

Now here's the mind-melting part: I use BitMEX. I've made most of my gains from there. (Yes, I know that US customers are ostensibly disallowed by BitMEX from using BitMEX, but we all know this is lip service, and it is not illegal in itself by US law to violate a site's T&S, and honestly BitMEX rocks so hard I'd be willing to set up an offshore company to keep using it). The [IRS virtual currency guidance](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf) defines cryptocurrency as ""property"" and seems to concern itself with ""exchange of virtual currency for other property"", which is taxable. Okay, but is a perpetual swap or futures contract taxable? How is it possible to calculate the ""cost basis"" of a BitMEX position, where posted margin can arbitrarily and dynamically scale? No actual buying or selling of bitcoin occurs on BitMEX, so how is it taxable? How is it reportable? How?

How the fuck do I even report any kind of short position on [Form 8949](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8949.pdf)? This would apply to Poloniex and Bitfinex as well.

The IRS stipulates different (and highly favorable) tax rules for conventional futures trading, such as the 60/40 rule, where as I understand it 60 percent of futures gains are considered long-term and 40 percent are considered short-term, as marked-to-market. Would this apply to BitMEX futures as well? And how about when, at the end, you withdraw your bitcoin from there and it becomes ""property"" again to sell for fiat?

Even if I went to a tax attorney or CPA, as I intend to do, would they know more than me what with the terribly incomplete guidance the IRS has given about all this? Nevermind the logistical insanity of the step-by-step fictional USD conversion process. And forget about bitcoin.tax; they don't handle BitMEX or any kind of serious trading activity.

I've made a lot of money. I'm fine with being taxed fairly on my net gain. But the IRS has not adequately addressed the problems I have described in their guidance. What the hell do I do?",2017-12-26 18:34:38

Non-full-nodes will not have any way to do lightweight verification, thus multiplying its degree of centralisation.

On top of all of this, the 21 full nodes will be delegates, which are voted in. By necessity, this turns consensus into a political process instead of an automated one. One of the practical effects of this is that the delegate nodes will be known/trusted third parties.

To sum up, EOS will be a trusted third party based ledger. Eliminating the need for trusted third parties was the great breakthrough that Satoshi made in inventing the PoW blockchain, and which Ethereum is putting all this work into to try to replicate with Proof of Stake.

TTP-based ledgers do not have the high assurance of immutability of permissionless Byzantine fault tolerant ones like Ethereum. Therefore, they're not as attractive for new projects as a platform to launch on.


EOS is more like an attempt to create an evolved version of the traditional centralized server-client architecture rather than an attempt to introduce a paradigm shift like Ethereum.

It actually starts with this wallet here:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/12f4885dad525cc1

Look familiar? Go to the last page, that was the wallet used to steal 19000BTC from Bitstamp back in January 2015 (and which was still receiving coins from Bitstamp as recently as September, well done guys).

This wallet made two transactions, the first is fairly innocuous but I'll come back to it later:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/7b46c7e412b1f1e93ff0aa67232457dde3fb6e91f4c61e025a97e56290049050

This address then sends out a further 0.01BTC:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1LBQpqUTEmdPTH8adaV6xS8KQt6FGCD3xD

The following morning it sends 0.01 to the address that was several hours later used to empty the Tether wallet:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

I'm not quite sure why they would make a deposit like this to it hours before - perhaps to test that everything is working?

*Edit: I think these payments were to ensure that they had BTC available to pay the fees needed to move that Tether as soon as they got it*

At 10:53, the wallet makes several transactions transferring 23 million tethers from the tether wallet:

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

Then at 11:10 they transfer another 7.9 million tethers. A further 50,000 tethers are transferred over at 11:54.

At 12:01, 5BTC (the bulk of the bitcoin in the tether wallet) is transferred over to the same address:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/e7e09cd092a5febdcae6b2ec76b06389c29298ed237dd1f210e1e54f096f1f92

These tethers are then transferred over to the address in the Tether announcement as their relevant blocks are confirmed.

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=16tg2RJuEPtZooy18Wxn2me2RhUdC94N7r

The 5BTC is also transferred to this address in amounts of roughly 1BTC per transaction:

Following the BTC along, you arrive back at an address from before, which is confirmed to be part of the wallet holding the stolen Tether:

It's worth noting that this same address was just used to create an Omni token called lioncoin:

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupsp.aspx?sp=2147484016

The BTC from the tether wallet ended up in these addresses:

https://blockchain.info/address/1HtmVRdFRqPScH7Ud6UFR6HUcndksjVmua

https://blockchain.info/address/155KG55pRsV1Y9jdwwynfGHGqR9cqPKToB

https://blockchain.info/address/1M8b8BNMEMFFem9UQpZydoespHzXjAnC9t

I will update this post as more develops.

*Edit 1*

This wallet from the Tether and Bitstamp hacks seems to be owned by the same person who took 12000BTC out of Huobi in late 2015, interesting...

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d

*Edit: Huobi are saying this is not a hack, so who knows why 12000 or so bitcoin was withdrawn from their exchange and combined with the coins from bitstamp [see here](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d) before being passed through several more wallets and onto BTC-e in batches of 1000 or so.*

Before he was taking thousands of BTC off exchanges and sending it to BTC-e, he also used to sell much smaller amounts on Localbitcoins.

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/02f08eddae4ba788

So Localbitcoins guys, if you have a log of who was using [this address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1EvTV4ySZbwwsRfL6T723cg1iiFASJbqH3) back in 2015, you've got the hacker ;)

*Edit 2*

So I was [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7eho5y/tether_was_hacked_by_the_same_person_who_hacked/dq558sd/) whether this could be an inside job.

Well, maybe? I don't think there's enough evidence from chain analysis alone to draw a conclusion.

Some of the transactions which funded the lioncoin address came from an old Bitfinex wallet, and [some came from the bitstamp hack address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/6b1a2139799a82b8). Bear in mind that this is [part of the same wallet](https://blockchain.info/tx/eeaf8b9c6288c28c481d6e37d687b5c42b0222fb3d8a73bdca81c1a12243c579) that the stolen tethers were sent to.

Also if you look at the [tether address](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=3BbDtxBSjgfTRxaBUgR2JACWRukLKtZdiQ&page=1) you'll notice that when other blocks of tether were released they were quickly transferred to the Bitfinex wallet, with this 30 million being the exception, that said in prior months they had regularly left millions of tether in this address for days at a time, so this isn't necessarily a red flag.

It could be that the attacker had access to the main tether issuance address (3MbYQMM etc) or it may just be that they noticed the 30 million tethers sat on the wallet that they could manipulate. Presumably Tether know whether or not they intended to make [this](https://omniexplorer.info/lookuptx.aspx?txid=dbde10653dd7f459260c11e2a80ae887f7c72e5bfd22f5d908b489dd430be764) transaction. Without knowing that we can only speculate on whether the compromise went beyond the address that was emptied.

*Edit 3*

There is a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tether/comments/7ei568/tether_return/) in which a /u/bitconexfoier1 claims to have bought 10M tethers, and provides an address that [received 10 million tethers](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=13kyHqsbtZpRHDNSdXWniJiCZPvRtMjVao) (now invalid) from the hackers.

My story of becoming a crypto millionaire and “poor” again,1815,bogyjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/bogyjm/my_story_of_becoming_a_crypto_millionaire_and/,440,1557857323.0,"I am writing this now from my phone, sitting in a bar in the slums of East Africa, enjoying my $0.60 beer in the shadow.

Here is my story.
I was working for a bank in Europe when a colleague told me about Ethereum end of 2016. That’s when I invested blindly what I had left from my savings. Boy I had no idea. It went well as you might know. I also had the right timing when I switched from Ethereum to EOS one year later. My initial investment was suddenly worth about almost 100x in a liquid market. Worth about a million. I didn’t tell anyone about that apart of my parents, my best friend and the colleague who told me about crypto.

That’s when my parents started asking me for help. And I was glad I was able to help. They are divorced and asked both separately. Soon I was also requested to help more family members, also outside of my country. My dad told everyone that his son is rich now. I was his best bank. I lend some 5-digits here and there I think. I don’t even know how much exactly. I never got back anything after a year and I don’t think I ever will. Also waiting 2 years already for some money I lend out.

I felt like...if nobody gives me back anything I need to make it back myself. I started gambling with DICE and EOSbet cryptocasino. And I did well for many months. I won about 9,000 EOS  with a careful strategy, a lot more EOS in the back and a lot of luck during this period. Then I lost all profits again with EOSbet within one day.
Until here it wasn’t even bad. I lost as much as I won. But also the crypto market had a serious pullback and my EOS weren’t worth as much anymore.

I got emotional after this step backwards and market-bought DICE at the wrong time, all in. I lost another big chunk there on top of the general crypto pullback. All this gave me so much stress for about a month. I also couldn’t carry the financial burdens of my parents and family on a monthly basis anymore. Not this frequent...

I felt like I don’t want to care about money anymore. It didn’t really make me happy, I didn’t really use it myself anyway. It created only problems because suddenly so many people had financial problems and literally begged me for help.

During all this time I was still living in my 2 room student apartment, without a kitchen or tv. I am 29 now and I never even afforded a car. 

2 months ago I decided to just quit everything and leave the country to have my peace. I quit my job because it wasn’t fun anymore and I didn’t care about the salary or money in general anymore. 

Now I am living amongst the poorest people on earth here in Africa and I am more happy than all those months before when I was living in Europe with all this money (on the paper).

This journey completely changed how I perceive money and how I value it.

Now let me have another beer. The weather is good and I finally started enjoying my life without any pressure. Still hodlin the rest of my investment in DICE and if it completely gets rekt and falls to 0 I am fine with it. I have found my peace here now, with money or without.

Then you have banksters such as Jamie Dimon, who see cryptocurrencies as the absolute biggest threat to his empire, and will say or do anything in his power to destroy them.

People like Warren Buffet, the old world money system, and frauds such as car insurance companies  are his thing, so you can't expect him to be a fan of decentralization, where the people would have the power, no no no, Warren likes the system just the way it is.

I'm using sql server, so i tried to provide a db agnostic as possible way to share this data, so i dumped it into a csv file. this is the table structure. Table name is CmcHistoricalPriceData

Id | CoinId | Symbol | Date	| Open | High | Low | Close | Volume | MarketCap
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
835561 | 1 | BTC | 2013-04-28 | 135.3 | 135.979| 132.1 | 134.21 | 0 | 1500519936

- The CoinId looks odd, but its used as a foreign key to other tables im using, mainly the coins provided via the free v2 api https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v2/listings/. full api here https://coinmarketcap.com/api/

- the Id field is just a primary key that increments by one for each new listing. i added non clustered index for faster retrieval, but eh, surprisingly it only ended up being 835561 rows. so not really any needed, the index uses the coinid and date.

i did some spot checks on https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/, looks to be accurate.

this data is useful for back testing, and general market analysis, if you use the R programming language you can do some interesting stuff with this data. 

As for their highest pricing tier with 5 years of historical data, there might be a richer data set, but i think the data provided in my table is enough to do most analysis. the only other data that would be useful would be exchange data, looking for arbitrage opportunities etc.

Only disappointing aspect of this data is that it doesnt go back past 2013, not sure how to go about getting that data.


Hope you guys like it. 

**edit**: If anyone who knows R can quickly show me how to build a set of the % difference of marketcap changes between the peak of mcap and the bottom historically, id really appreciate that, hope that question makes sense.

**another edit**: here is the table, the types are not correct e.g. decimal, but it does the job. just run it if ur using sql server, or u can prob run it thru an online converter for ur db of choice. if you can suggest a better decimal type for this kinda data id like that too.

There are alt-coins with technology that puts bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, and ethereum to shame. Are they easy to purchase? NO. Will it take 1-2 years for them to catch on? YES. Will there be insane price fluctuations that make you sick to your stomach? YES.

Welcome to fucking cryptocurrency. No one is going to do the homework for you. No one is going to click the buy button for you. No one is going to stay up late at night with you when the shit falls 40% in 3 hours. It takes balls to ride this ride - this early in the game.

Find the coins with the best tech - small market cap - somewhat low supply (depending on the intended use) - good development team - active community. Put some money in at the right time - then HODL for the long game. Check back in 2 years and hope for 2000% returns.

Good luck.",2017-12-21 22:46:11

"How I ended up with $55,000 in Crypto for free because of a hack.",1759,88wx8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/88wx8z/how_i_ended_up_with_55000_in_crypto_for_free/,426,1522673597.0,"First off I would like to start off by saying that I had nothing to do with the hack. I was also entitled to every last bit that I gained, and taxes were of course paid. (Short version at the bottom)

This is a pretty good story. So be patient, I'm not putting it out there to get anyone jealous .  

I started off with a my first crypto investment with ripple last March. 

Somewhere around August well after Ripple already mooned, I decided to cash out half my gains for a very nice profit. I also figured it would be a good idea to sell some off about $500 worth and toss it into a handful of low mcap shitcoins. Why not? Its all house money at this point. 

After browsing CMC, I discovered smart cash. The price was so low about half of a penny, and after doing some research, it seemed like a pretty good idea helping out 3rd world countries. 

I figured ""what the hell "" some of this shit might actually stick, and the website was very presentable . I also liked the experience since the team came from Dash.  I spent about 50 or $60 and got 10,000 smart cash. There was also this Rewards program where if you held them in your wallet you would get 25% extra a month.  

I dumped it into my smart rewards wallet and pretty much forgot about it for a few months. Since that point I really didn't pay much attention to crypto at all. I was preparing to get married, I went on a honeymoon, my wife was pregnant yada yada. 

Also, my wife was telling me, **""you gonna lose all your money""**

I said, **""um um NO NO NO!""**

Anyway, here comes December rolling along, and I get a phone call from a friend frantic about how to buy ripple.  That's another story. Lol

  After that I started checking out prices.., my ripples were up to 70 cents.  Everything was mooning.   That's when I noticed SmartCash peeping its head out on the 2nd page at about 20 cents.   At this point I forgot how much i had. When I looked into my smart rewards wallet I was sitting with over 17k smartcash .   
Everyday it kept climbing till it hit about 50 cents.      

 I'm happy as shit at this point, in checking prices of my cryptos every 1hr on the 1hr.  All my shitcoins are going up.    *Euphoria*. 

However, a couple days later something strange happened with the smartcash price. 

It started tanking hard (this was before the total market crash occurred) it was down to 25 cents and falling.    I knew something was weird, and I thought maybe something bad happened with the project.  Maybe they got an order to shut down. Whatever the case was, I didnt have time to think rationally because Every 5 minutes it was losing pennies at time.   I quickly sent everything to cryptopia because it was still at 25 cents each for LTC only. I wanted to get my profits asap. Can you blame me?  lol.  By the time the transaction approved it was already down to 17 cents each. Not even 30 minutes later.   However I noticed Coin Exchange low volume they were still paired with DogeCoin at 48 cents each.  So... Screw it, I sold 5k for 17cents each, and sent the remaining 12k to CoinEx.  I got it there just in time. Although there was very low volume there was enough buy orders up to profit a total of 45 cents each.  

 NICE... At this point all pairings tanked to about 9-10cents each.  Screw it. I converted all doge back to BTC and bought 20k back for 9 cents each, and I still had about 3k in BTC.  

That's when I noticed smart was still selling for around 15 cents each on Cryptopia , and 18 cents each on HITBTC.   I sent 5k to HitBTC, 10k to Cryptopia, and 5k back to my rewards wallet.  

Again, screw it, I was trying to make a quick profit. Prices were so unbalanced, I didn't know what the hell was going on.  All I knew is that something bad happened and the coin is tanking.  No time to think lol .  

That's when everything got Frozen and all my transactions were caught in limbo. Nothing was verified except for coin exchange telling me the transaction was complete. I did get my 5K smart cash to hitbtc.  That was good. But I wasn't getting anything on my web wallet or Cryptopia for hrs.

So naturally like everybody else would do I was looking for answers on Reddit, the website etc.
Turns out there was a coin hack, and the hacker minted millions of coins and was liquidating all of them on every exchange. That's what caused the price to tank so quickly. 

The developers ordered a Freeze of all transactions across every exchange, and burned the same amount of coins that were minted.    Somewhere mixed in the announcements on discord the devs weren't taking the minted coins back due to being unfair for the people who bought them from the hacker. There main concern was fixing the hack, and getting everything updated.

**Now to the exchanges** 

At this point Cryptopia, CoinEx, and HitBTC weren't continuing transactions until they updated their wallets, canceled all current transactions , and got issued the new coins by the SmartCash team in the amount they held, withdrew , etc etc for that entire day.    I'm a little pissed because I'm out thousands of coins, and I have no clue when I'm getting them back , but not entirely, after all at least I have 3k in BTC for the $50 I spent lol,  not to shabby. However, to all the people that bought in at the ATH and had pending transactions..  That sucks.  My PW to my web wallet wasn't working, and the devs disabled all wallets until ""further update"". 


Meanwhile, the 5k coins I had on HitBTC started to moon.  They rose to over 3 bucks!.    I knew something wasnt right. It was a mad house, so I sold all of them off for almost $15,000.   idgaf after that.   I was right, this whole situation was messed up.  The only reason those mooned was because of extremely low volume, and it was the only exchanged that worked...noobs were pouring in buying up the supply.       Hey, I'm now sitting with $18,000 in BTC .    I really cant complain, however I would like my other 15k coins back, who wouldn't?  

This went on for about a week, and the devs mad an announcement that the web wallets have been updated, and we could now sign in. 
I did exactly that.   What did I find?  The exact 17,328 coins I originally had sent to cryptopia to sell 5k, and send the 12k to CoinEx ?????   

Ok. i figured it was an honest mistake. Amid the mayhem the devs just wanted everyone to have their coins back .  They rolled back transactions and everyone who withdrew got re-credited . 

 After speaking to a few mods and other members, it was intentional. It was a lot easier for them to give everyone double what they had ""if they withdrew within a certain time frame"" then to sit through all this mess.  It wasn't bad. We were only talking maybe a million extra coins in circulation compared to over a billion coins.     

Now I'm here sitting with $18k in BTC, and all my coins back, I'm happier than a pig in shit,  but there was no place to sell these coins since no exchange had updated their wallets. These were ""the new version of SmartCash coins "" , lol jokes on me right?   Not.  It gets better. 

A couple more days pass, and CryptoBridge gets created.  We were able to send coins there and sell them.    I sold them for about $1.10 each.   I now have over $35,000 in BTC.   I also have an additional 15k SmartCash waiting for me after Cryptopia rebroadcasts their transactions.   2 more weeks go buy, and so does the total market crash from the ATH, its at the point where the market recovered back to 500 Billion from $294 billion.  SmartCash is still selling for 70-80 cents on CryptoBridge when finally Cryptopia updated their wallets, and all transactions deposits/withdrawals were rebroadcasted.      

I sign on and what do I find?   Not just my 10k SmartCash from the coin exchange deposit,  I also find  the original 17,328 I sent from my web wallet the day of the hack.  Lmao.    So not only do I hit $35 grand, I have way more SmartCash.    
I sold all 27k of them on CryptoBridge for about $18000 over the course of 2 days.    this wasn't a mistake.  The team said in announcements about exchanges rebroadcasting, and I was told we would get double .  When I asked why I was told ""that's just how the exchanges work in this situation. We have to re-credit them all the new coins yada yada"".        When asked if I can keep these, they said yes, its not a problem ""        ok so the market dips again, and CoinEX finally gets back up and running.    

Yeah you guessed it. They rebroadcasted all transactions also.   Yes, I ended up with another 5k in my webwallet, and 10K on Cryptopia.   

Yes, Cryptopia rebroadcasted all deposits,  CoinEx rebroadcasted all withdrawals , and the web wallets also reset .        That's how I ended up with a free $55,000.  That of course got cashed out. I'm debt free now lol.  Also my original 17k SmartCash is still back.       I traded off half of them for alts, then donated the rest back to SmartCash.      

Crazy right? 

**EDIT:** *SHORT VERSION*

- The price of SmartCash suddenly started tanking.  

- I panicked , and sent all 17,328 smart to Cryptopia to sell before it tanked further 

- I sold 5k for 17 cents, and sent the remaining 12k Smart to CoinEx because doge/smart was still $0.48 each at very low volume(lucky catch)

- I sold 12k smart for about $5,000 in doge. 

- I converted $5000 doge to $5000 BTC

- I purchased 20k Smart at about 9-10 cents each for $2000BTC 

- This left me with $3000 in BTC, and 20,000 Smart

- I sent 5k smart to HitBTC that went through so I can sell them for more than what I purchased them for.

- I sent 10k to Cryptopia for the same reason I sent them to HitBTC (prices were all over the place), and to my web wallet
Which got confirmed on CoinEx but never confirmed to Cryptopia or my Web wallet

- Turns out there was a hack were someone minted millions of coins and was selling which was causing the price to dip, and devs ordered a freeze of all pending transactions , and a freeze of trading on Cryptopia

- I was locked out of my web wallet until the devs updated it with the patch

- Wallets were put back online , but reset to the original amount that was there before I originally sent out my coins the first time

- that left me with the original 17,328 smart coins, 5k smart on HitBTC , $3000 in BTC, and ""pending transactions of a total of 15,000 smart""

- when looking for answers, I was told by the team I would get double my coins on Cryptopia once they rebroadcasted all transactions because ""thats just how exchanges worked"", and I could keep them. 

- I sold the 5k smart on HitBTCfor about $15,000 in BTC (turns out I was false price inflation do to low volume and the only exchange that trades were availble on

- weeks later Cryptopia put smart back online and rebroadcasted my original,deposit of 17,328 from my web wallet , and approved the 10k smart Deposited from Coin Ex.  

- sometime a week later the 5k to my web wallet also got approved.   

- I was now left with $18,000 in BTC, and about 50,000 SmartCash that was all sold off at various different days as it was all playing out

You wanna make money in Crypto? Well read this...,1738,6zslih,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6zslih/you_wanna_make_money_in_crypto_well_read_this/,295,1505308896.0,"For a lot of people on here, much of this will be common sense...

But as a reminder, here are some thoughts I would like to remind people that are in this game together with us.

*1. Do not listen to anyone. Always be skeptical of opinions, no matter how credible or famous the person or organization making the claim.

Some of us want to take the easy way by finding someone hyping a coin on the internet. If you are trying to find the next big coin, and are basing your investment based on other people's opinions; you will likely not succeed. You have to go out and seek your own investments based on your own research. If you go on youtube, and seek some dude hyping some coin and invest with no facts in your arsenal, you will likely fail. If you invest in a coin because it is popular at the moment, and jump on the hype wagon you will fail. Hyped coins are already likely at a top. It will correct itself, and you may panic sell. Recently, I bought Omise Go at 2$. When I bought Omise Go at 2$, there were no Youtube videos of big crypto youtubers hyping the coin (yes I looked). Now we know how that worked out, and everyone is making videos and hype about Omise Go. I made nice profit from this investment from my own research..

If you sell because of negative speculation, you may likely fail. The only thing you should believe are facts. If China, or another country actually bans bitcoin, that is a fact. If Wallstreet Journal, Glodman Sachs, or Charlie Lee posts an opinion that bitcoin to fiat exchanges will be banned with no proof, that is an opinion. (Claiming to have some super secret source saying XXXX is not proof). If warren buffet or the CEO of Goldman Sachs says bitcoin is a tulip mania and will be worth nothing, that is still an opinion of some old guy that likely does not even have a clue of what smart contracts are. These kinds of claims have been made by famous figures throughout the past, and have so far only been proven wrong.

*2. Your portfolio value will crash (eventually), but that is okay. When times are good, everyone feels like they are a genius. If your coin tripled in a month, you may feel like you are a genius. But do not forget the fact that what comes up must go down. What goes down, has great potential to eventually come back much stronger. This does not go for all investments, only the ones that have real value. If your investment sucks, then it will only go down.

*3. (This part is my opinion, take this with a grain of salt. See line 1): Believe it or not, blockchain technology is now a practical and very useful technology at its current state than it ever was in the history of blockchain. Smart contract applications have opened a whole new world of innovation and practicality to our space. These are very exciting times, and many believe our total marketcap is severely undervalued.

*4. It is possible that regulation will screw cryptocurrencies forever. Just because cryptocurrencies are decentralized, does not mean countries cannot ban it. If countries do ban it, cryptocurrencies will obviously become much more useless. What are most owners of bitcoin to do with illegal bitcoin? If central banks do not like blockchain, they certainly have the power to do severe harm. They do have the power to influence elections, businesses, entire markets, or even buy up our entire marketcap if they so desire. It is scary for us to think about in terms of the harm governments and central banks can pose to our very precious crypto.

*5. Do not forget the fact that you are playing a game of high risk, high reward. Cryptocurrencies in its current form are VERY volatile. Do not expect to win forever, or lose forever. Some days you will cry, others you will hysterically laugh at your success, dance around your room, or even drive lambos. However, just because your dad or friend claims crypto currencies are too unstable, a Joke or whatever; do not trust their word. You likely have much more knowledge about crypto than them, or even the CEO of Goldman Sachs or whatever. (I may be wrong but that is my opinion).

Lastly, have fun. I love cryptocurrencies, I am hooked. I am having so much fun trading, hodling, speculating, and engaging with this community.

Thank you to everyone involved, and bringing me this excitement to engage in this wild game. 

If you have any thoughts or opinions, please do share (even if you did not like this post).

# What is Blockchain X?

Blockchain X is a global enterprise level public blockchain platform. VeChainThor is referring to their network/protocol as Blockchain X, to differentiate it from Bitcoin (Blockchain 1.0) and Ethereum (Blockchain 2.0 = Blockchain 1.0 + Smart Contracts). 

###Blockchain X = Blockchain 2.0 + IoT + AI + VET/VeThor = A living digital ecosystem

- Blockchain = structure - bones, muscle etc (immutable trustworthy network)
- IoT = senses - touch, vision, taste, smell, sound (collect real world information from RFID/NFC/QR etc.)
- VET/VeThor = bone marrow/blood - generate blood & circulate (value transfer on the network)
- AI = brain - information synthesis (automation of network with deep learning)

# VeChainThor: the top candidate for enterprise and government level adoption of Blockchain

VeChainThor has an extremely strong development plan geared towards enterprise and government level adoption. If successful in their execution, I see VeChain being the leading cryptoasset comparable to Ethereum in size. The reasons I believe they will succeed are due to their ecosystem development, innovative governance model, robust economic model and strong strategic partnerships. The evidence of their success is snowballing with each new enterprise level partner and client.

## DApps & Ecosystem development

The infrastructure layer has adoption in mind at the very core. Governments and enterprises will prioritise **safety and security** before venturing into blockchain adoption. (Mentioned in the introduction video.) The core DApps, VeVID (Verified identity, KYC/AML), VeVOT (Voting, Governance tool) and VeSCC (Smart Contract Certification, Regulatory compliance) provide the safety and security that governments and enterprises will demand. Blockchain X will have built-in KYC/AML, Governance and Regulation compliance. This sets it apart from other protocols and ICO platforms.

## Governance model

The governance model is a balanced mix of decentralisation and centralisation. With problems such as Bitcoin's scaling debate, it appears that a purely decentralised governance structure may be inefficient. [VeChain will use a new model of a decentralised system through centralised channels.] (https://www.vechain.org/about#organization) The final decisions will be made in a decentralised democratic process through VeVOT by stakeholders with voting authority. I believe this model will be more widely adopted as it retains some of the efficient centralised channels that enterprise & government are familiar with, while still giving overall control to the network participants via a democratic voting system.

## Economic model

The [two-token economic model] (https://www.vechain.org/technology#vet) splits the value in the network into VET and VeThor. VET's primary function is to generate VeThor. VeThor represents the underlying costs of using the VeChainThor blockchain. All smart contract execution and transactions will require payment with VeThor. Through the dynamic rate of VeThor generation, the fiat value of VeThor can be kept relatively stable. For example, if the VeThor price was too high due to an increase in enterprise demand, the VeThor generation rate can be increased, which increases supply, and brings the price back down. The opposite is also true if the VeThor price is too low. The way I see VET is a store of value, a representation of ownership of part of the network and the right to use the network. Whereas VeThor is the perfect medium of exchange and a pure utility token. By using a two-token system, VeThor can have a stable fiat value over a long period of time. A company will be able to calculate how much VeThor will be needed for a consistent fiat value year after year and will be able to budget for this. This is extremely useful for enterprise and government level adoption since it removes the inherent price volatility from a nascent market like crypto.

VeChain also has a Node system, whereby holding VET generates additional rewards. Nodes of different levels will generate up to 200% additional VeThor compared to the base rate. This encourages long term staking in the network and decreases volatility. See the [Apotheosis Part II article] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-apotheosis-part-ii-thor-power-forged-974111a93278) and [X Series Node article](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-x-series-6b77b746b4b2) for more information. A portion of VET supply will be locked up when nodes activate. Long term VET holders will not sell and downgrade their status. This decreased supply will lead to price increases. Early adopters (Deadline to stake: Before 20th March 2018) will be rewarded in the new X Series Node system. Features include exclusive participation in VeChain ecosystem project whitelists. (Something I'm excited about since I believe there will be a handful of reverse ICOs from traditional enterprise clients)

## Technology

VeChain is planning on adding [more than 100 additional full-time developers by the end of 2018.] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-financial-executive-report-vol-2-2fb65e91dad1)

For those interested in the technology of Blockchain X, I would direct you to the Medium AMAs where the VeChain team have provided detailed answers to common questions. [Hardware 1]
(https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-technical-ama-hardware-questions-part-1-ce7a5f19c3e1), [Hardware 2] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-technical-ama-hardware-questions-part-2-6f6a0c79b630), [Software 1]( https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-technical-ama-software-questions-part-1-cb17c830e458) and [Software 2] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-technical-ama-software-questions-part-2-294a5c58044c) are worth a read.

## Strategic partners

The three strategic partners each play a key role in VeChainThor's expansion. [PWC] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PricewaterhouseCoopers) has clients which make up 85% of the Fortune 500. [DNV-GL] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNV_GL) is the preferred provider of those Fortune 500 companies for management systems certification services. PWC and DNV-GL will serve to introduce their enterprise clients to VeChain and increase adoption. [BitOcean] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-bitocean-7f12402e13b0) is positioning itself as a Fiat on-ramp for Crypto in Japan through physical ATMs and online exchanges, with approval by Japan's Financial Services Authority. BitOcean also plans to operate in China when regulations are finalised. BitOcean represents a Fiat/VET pairing that may serve to decouple VET/BTC and lead to independence of VET from the whims of BTC price.

## Evidence of adoption to date: Existing clients & Investors

VeChain currently has 180 business opportunities in their pipeline for 2018 (compared to 4 use cases in 2016 and 22 in 2017). [They have real uses cases and existing clients](https://www.vechain.org/enterprise#usecases) that range from medium to large enterprises. Revealed clients include Chinese Government [Gui'an New Area project] (https://cdn.vechain.com/vechain_national_government_partnership_guian_release.pdf), BMW, Groupe Renault, DIG, Kuehne + Nagel, China Unicom, NRCC - State Tobacco, MLILY, Sunshine culture, Hubei Sanxin Cultural Media, Fanghuwang, YIDA future, Madeforgoods and iTaotaoke. Each of these partnerships deserve a detailed post on their own, they are all available on VeChain's Medium page. Taken together, it becomes clear what type of Ecosystem VeChainThor is trying to build.

Jiangsu Printed Electronics and Xiamen Innov Information Technology are technology partners and I suspect will be mass producing the RFID/NFC chips. 

[Breyer Capital] (https://breyercapital.com/portfolio/) and [Fenbushi capital] (http://www.fenbushi.vc/index_en.html) are the two featured investors on VeChain's website. Jim Breyer generally makes some pretty smart investment decisions. His only other crypto investments are Circle and Ethereum.

**Bonus news**: This week they are presenting with DNV-GL a cold chain supply chain solution at the Global Food Safety Initiative conference 2018. Zoom in and you'll see [VeChain Intelligent Control Display System.] (https://twitter.com/DNVGL/status/970852759615475713) DNV-GL have also launched their new digital assurance solution, My Story™. Four top Italian wine producers are using My Story™ under supervision of the Italian wine authorities. [Twitter] (https://twitter.com/dnvgl/status/971137787226243073?s=21) and [DNVGL] (https://www.dnvgl.com/news/dnv-gl-launches-my-story-the-blockchain-based-solution-to-tell-the-product-s-full-story-113549) link.


## China's potential

China is widely known to be anti-cryptocurrency but extremely pro-blockchain. China's ""13th Five year plan 2016-2020"" focuses on moving up in the value chain by abandoning old heavy industry and building up bases of modern information-intensive infrastructure, with blockchain and Smart Cities being a key technological focus. VeChain has achieved approval from the Government of the People's Republic of China with [Gui'an New Area project] (https://cdn.vechain.com/vechain_national_government_partnership_guian_release.pdf), multiple mentions on state owned media (CCTV) and deals with state owned enterprises (China Tobacco). China will not fall behind in the international Blockchain race, they will finalise regulations and adopt Blockchain rapidly in the coming years. VeChain appears to be one of the leaders in the field, with their largest office in Shanghai and existing government connections.


## Leader in the field

Last but not least, VeChain is leading the field in a number of areas.

1. [Academic research] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/initiating-veresearch-a-global-research-grant-program-focused-on-innovative-blockchain-1af41dbdc63a): VeResearch with [Michigan State University] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-introduces-michigan-state-university-as-first-veresearch-participant-and-pioneering-the-mec-c8dec3015914) #1 for supply chain management and another university to be announced
2. Transparency: quarterly financial reports, regular social media updates, multiple AMAs, response to r/cryptocurrency ban, directly addressing FUD in official Telegram channels
3. Corporate responsibility: [cryptocurrency disaster recovery plan] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-passes-the-first-ever-cryptocurrency-disaster-recovery-plan-from-pwc-f69ccf238a7a) 
4. Environmental responsibility: Carbon bank initiative with DNV-GL

## Skeptics section
In the interests of balanced discussion, I will update this section with skepticism I find in the comments below.

1. ""No whitepaper""
 - VeChain are working on a Whitepaper as part of their Q1 2018 goals. Information normally found in a Whitepaper has been made available through the [development plan] (https://cdn.vechain.com/vechain_ico_ideas_of_development_en.pdf). I'm actually not too fussed about not having a whitepaper. For me evidence of enterprise adoption is a more useful indicator of how successful VeChainThor could be.

2. ""No official wallet"" ""No Mainnet""
 - VeChainThor has been operating as a private blockchain since June 2016. Public VeChainThor Blockchain Launch, VeChain Wallet with VeThor Forge Function will be released in Q2 2018 according to the [roadmap.] (https://www.vechain.org/#roadmap)

3. ""VeChain are dumping their VET on the open market""
 - False FUD. Addressed by VeChain Foundation directly in the Official Telegram channel.
 - [Telegram quotes from Sunny Lu CEO](https://np.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/81nv39/sunny_lu_came_into_the_vechain_telegram_chat_to/)
 - [Telegram quotes from Kevin Feng COO]
(https://np.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/81ok37/kevin_feng_cfo_was_also_in_the_tg_to_address_the/)

4.  ""Can we talk about the fact that the BMW ""partnership"" is not really a partnership? VEN is allowed to participate into a startup program hosted by BMW. BMW is not a client. http://www.bmwstartupgarage.com/partner "" - u/DutchDolt
 - ""BMWstartupgarage"" has neither been confirmed or denied by BMW or VeChain, it has been spread by a youtuber called ""Crypto Gem""
 - Going to the website linked, BMW refers to successful participants as both partners and clients
 - This is still a developing partnership with details under NDA, however the VeChain/BMW link has been confirmed at the [VeChain rebranding event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfAEir7uT_g&feature=youtu.be&t=36m48s)
and by [Sarah VeChain Country Manager] (https://twitter.com/mspandorah/status/968441330320855040)

5. ""Vote manipulation"" ""Shilling"" ""Brigading"" ""You're a paid shiller""
 - In the past VeChain Telegram Moderators wilfully participated in brigading, leading to the ban on the word ""VeChain"" for 30 days in r/cryptocurrency
 - It is difficult to differentiate manipulated behaviour and organic behaviour on Reddit, the moderators here do an amazing job getting rid of spam and detecting vote manipulation
 - The Official VeChain Foundation has stepped in to help Reddit moderators prevent VeChain vote manipulation
 - Official Telegram Rules: Brigading & Reddit links: We have a new policy regarding Reddit and 'brigading'. No brigading of any kind will be allowed. If you want to post a Reddit link, do so with the ""np."" prefix added to its URL, for example ""np.reddit.com /r/CryptoCurrency"". No spamming for upvotes, as it hurts both of our communities.
 - This is strictly enforced by Telegram moderators and results in a warning then an insta-ban for repeat offenders
 - https://imgur.com/a/sOva9 is being copy-pasted en masse by detractors as evidence of brigading
 - Image shows Boxminig feeling sorry for WTC PR team and a ""np"" link to a different thread
 - I wish I got paid to shill VeChain, I made this post to share a fundamentally strong crypto with the community

Lesson For All Newbies.",1700,7jyze7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7jyze7/how_i_went_from_10_btcs_to_30_btcs_to_05_btcs/,732,1513363740.0,"I started hearing, investigating and buying cryptocurrency coins from around May 2017. I started off by making a little bit of money, losing money, making a whole lot of money, and currently I'm in a situation whereby I've lost a whole lot of money. This includes initial money invested.

In May, June & July 2017, I started off by putting in fiat to buy about 10 Bitcoins worth of cryptocurrencies. I bought Bitcoins and then alt coins over a number of weeks. The market was in a sideways movement mostly. There were days when my portfolio was red, and days when it was green. What I did right was I hodled all the coins until I was profitable.

August 2017. I made extremely great gains during this month, because the market was in a bull run and I'm sure most people made great gains. I went from having about 10 Bitcoins worth of alt coins to having about 30. I was extremely euphoric, and started making plans of when I'll resign from my job, pay off my house one day soon, etc. Only thing I did right was I didn't brag to other people about my crazy gains. I kept it to myself. 

September 2017. This was when the China FUD happened, markets dipped in a huge way. This time instead of hodling, I sold my alt coins. By then I was down from about 25 Bitcoins worth of alt coins to about 9. The other stupid strategy that I adopted was I wanted to go back to having 30 Bitcoins, and have that feeling again of invincibility. So I started gambling, hoping for a coin that would give me a quick 2x or more gain. I would buy a coin, and if it dropped I would sell it.

October & November 2017. Pretty much the same thing happened, whereby I was gambling and not investing. I would buy a coin that I thought would rise in a few days. If it didn't rise or it fell in price, I would sell it and fomo into a coin that was rising at that time. As most of you might know, FOMOing seldom works, because you end up buying at an ATH. The price drops, you panic sell and the price resumes up again or continues dropping. Either way, I was losing money. By the end of November, I had about 3 Bitcoins worth of alt coins from 9.

December 2017. We're now in the middle of December and it has been brutal, I didn't learn anything. I would buy an alt coin, and if it didn't rise I would sell it. There were some coins were I made some gains, but I sold quickly and those coins continued rising. I also bought coins that were considered good, they dropped and I sold after seeing a coin that was rising. I am now in a situation where I went from having 3 Bitcoins worth of alt coins to now having 0.5.

I'm hodling a coin now, and my tokens are at MEW. I have no option but to hodl. I have so little money that I'm willing to wait 6 months to get a 2x, so I can at least have 1 Bitcoin worth of an alt coin. Provided the alt coin keeps up with the price of Bitcoin. Even if the market corrects 50%, I'll still hodl.

In terms of fiat, I lost about 80% of all money invested. I'm literally broke, lol. The money I spent years saving is gone because of stupid, uneducated and gambling type of trades. In order words, I went into crypto with about $50k, to a high of about $170k, and now I only have about $10k.

The purpose of this post is to release my feelings and disappointment, but also for other people to learn from my crypto rooky mistakes and for them not make the same mistakes I've been making.

Hopefully most of you guys have made massive profits, and may you continue to make money money. As for me, all I'm hoping for is a gain back $50k.",2017-12-16 02:49:00

50 Crypto Trading & Investing Lessons Learned Over The Past 5 Years,1670,7o8w78,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7o8w78/50_crypto_trading_investing_lessons_learned_over/,255,1515156664.0,"By Chris Dunn

1 - Everyone’s a genius in a bull market. Real traders can survive and even thrive in bear markets or highly volatile markets.

2 - Don’t be a blind bull. ALL markets are cyclical. Don’t be afraid of pullbacks or market crashes – that’s where you can make the most money.

3 - There’s a big difference between a trade and an investment.

4 - Fully plan your trade before you pull the trigger on the entry.

5 - Entries are important, but risk & money management is where you make or lose money.

6 - Beware of get-rich-quick gurus hopping on the crypto bandwagon over the past year.

7 - Decide which types of trade setups or investments you’ll take and ignore everything else.

8 - Don’t assume just because you’ve made a lot of money in crypto that you can just as easily make money in other financial markets. 95%+ of stock market traders LOSE money. The game is rigged. Stick to what you know works for you.

9 - The best way to day trade cryptocurrencies is – DON’T!

10 - The best way to profit in any market is to find something you think has big potential early (before the general public catches on), and invest assuming you’re going to lose 100% of your capital. It’s the “angel investor” approach.

11 - You can’t control the market. The only thing you can control is your entries, trade size, and exits.

12 - One market participant can completely destroy “good technical analysis”.

13 - Don’t blindly follow trade alerts from ANYONE, especially random people on social media or chat rooms.

14 - All financial networking marketing projects are ponzi schemes, period.

15 - If you make a life-changing amount of money, do NOTHING for at least 30 days.

16 - Trading isn’t about picking exact tops and bottoms in a market – it’s about catching the meat of a move.

17 - Don’t turn a small losing trade into a massive losing investment.

18 - Don’t set daily profit target goals – set long-term performance goals.

19 - Learn to survive, then thrive.

20 - The best charting indicators are price action and volume. You can use others, but it won’t necessarily make you a more profitable trader.

21 - Trends can go way past what seems rational.

22 - Don’t try to pick tops in a market. Wait for the market to tell you when the trend is over.

23 - Don’t trade in front of big news events – it’s impossible to predict how markets will react.

24 - The biggest challenge for most traders is their ego, or the need to be right.

25 - You can lose 50% of your trades and still be profitable if you manage risk properly.

26 - The best entrepreneurs and CEO’s typically make the worst traders and investors.

27 - People with the best mindset for investing typically have a career in high-risk situations like firefighters, pilots, police.

28 - Avoid pump and dump groups like the plague they are.

29 - You WILL make every mistake in the book. Don’t beat yourself up when you make mistakes, just learn and try not to make the same mistake twice.

30 - Don’t treat crypto exchanges like bank accounts. You don’t own the coins unless you control the private keys.

31 - Crypto is a 24/7/365 market. You can’t catch every trade. If you miss one, don’t worry – there’s ALWAYS another trade.

32 - Don’t invest in a coin unless you understand it inside out.

33 - You can make money trading the momentum and hype in shitcoins, just don’t invest long-term.

34 - Stay away from coins with low trading volume and low market caps. They are easily manipulated and you can get stuck in a position.

35 - Don’t trade with money you need for living expenses. It’s called “risk capital” for a reason.

36 - Think of yourself as a hunter – save your ammo for the big game.

37 - Crypocurrency exchanges go down when there’s high volatility. If price hits a major target or buy zone, it might make sense to place some orders BEFORE everyone else.

38 - Trading and investing brings all your emotions to the forefront – fear, greed, hesitation.

39 - The hardest thing to do in trading is… NOTHING. This can also be the most profitable thing to do.

40 - Just because a market is in a “bubble” doesn’t mean it’s going to die. Bitcoin has been through over half a dozen big bubbles and increased in price after each one.

41 - Manage your trades in a way that would leave you with no regrets no matter what the market does.

42 - Learn to think like a contrarian. If you’re someone who needs to have your opinion validated by everyone around you, then trading and investing isn’t for you.

43 - The shorter the chart time frame, the less reliable the chart patterns are. The longer the time frame, the more variables affect price action and the harder it becomes to predict price. My sweet spot in the daily chart for trade setups and 60-minute chart for entries.

44 - Some market conditions are great for pushing the gas on every trade setup you can find, where other market conditions call for you to slam on the brakes and step away from the markets altogether.

45 - 90%+ of cryptocurrencies will eventually go to zero. Invest accordingly.

46 - The mental side of trading is the hardest to master, the most under-appreciated skill, and will cause you to make or lose the biggest amounts of money.

47 - The 3 biggest problems for traders are over-trading, hesitating on entries, and closing positions prior to profit targets when the trade is still intact.

48 - You can make a career’s worth of profit in one year or one trade – don’t feel like every day has to be a home run. Play the long game. Be patient and wait for the best plays.

49 - Don’t trust anyone else to trade for you. Manage your own high-risk investments (like crypto trading) or don’t participate at all.

50 - Take the news for what it is – they’re trying to get views and clicks. They’re NOT looking out for your best interests or trying to help you make money.",2018-01-05 20:51:04

Announcing: Bitcoin Platinum - A revolutionary evolution of Bitcoin.,1663,78xtrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/78xtrq/announcing_bitcoin_platinum_a_revolutionary/,233,1509073873.0,"Hello fellow bitcoin hodlers! After many years of dissecting Bitcoin's code and hiring a top team of engineers (to be paid with BTP **only**) we are announcing the latest in blockchain innovation:

#Bitcoin Platinum

Get ready for that moon lambo! We are currently working to get all of our ducks in a row, but there are a few links I can provide you with to get you more familiar with this life changing Bitcoin adaptation.


###Our GitHub:
[https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU](https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU)

Although this is the Bitcoin Gold codebase, we plan to fork it once they figure out all of their issues and then we'll just probably add nothing else to it.

###Our Website:
[https://bitcoingold.org/](https://bitcoingold.org/)

Again, this is the Bitcoin Gold website but we plan to create a new website by just copying their code. Our top engineer has told us that replacing every instance of ""Gold"" with ""Platinum"" in the codebase will be a very complicated process, so to ease this transition we have our entire team working on a Google Chrome plugin that will replace the word ""Gold"" with ""Platinum."" Unfortunately, due to our team generally solving much harder problems, they are not familiar with how to scope this to our website and the word ""Gold"" will be replaced on all websites you visit. We plan to release an Internet Explorer toolbar in the near future as well, but we will not be developing for FireFox because this isn't the 2000's.

**That's pretty much it!**

I can't wait to launch this endeavor with this wonderful community. We're so close and we want to share with you that we will be forking from the main blockchain at 00:00 UTC on October 28th!!!

See you on the moon!",2017-10-27 11:11:13

It's so nice to see a sea of green for once. To take advantage of the current market uptick, Pineapple Fund has made a number of donations today!

* We donated $2 million to the Institute for Justice, which takes strategic litigation to defend important areas like economic liberty and fighting civil forfeiture. 

* We donated $500k to TreeSisters, which is planting almost 2 million trees per year while providing an income to women in countries like Kenya.

* We donated $250k to human-I-T, who re-distributes old computers and electronics to people in need, reducing the gap of access to technology while also reducing electronic waste.

* We donated $1 million to The Adventure Project, who sponsors training for women to help them move out of poverty and  lead impactful lives.

* We also donated $2 million, to complete our $5 mil donation to the Open Medicine Foundation, who is funding much-needed and underfunded research into ME/CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome).

Pineapple Fund has just about 850 BTC left, and we've committed all of our remaining funds to charities already... except a little bit for a fun crypto puzzle in the end. Stay tuned ;)",2018-02-08 03:32:50

I don't know about you guys, but I never ever use Bitcoin to do anything, and only use Ethereum or Litecoin when I need to transfer and trade, and I'm pretty sure all of you do as well.

Once they pair Ethereum with everything, it will not only save us time, but money as well, because we won't have to transform whatever we used to transfer quickly back into Bitcoin, in order to buy what we want... a win win!

Although, I see this as a very bad thing for Bitcoin though, because what would we need it for if or when this happens... time will tell I guess.

Vergins still think this is ""only"" a DDoS of mining pools as officials claimed (ROFL) while the attacker is possibly gaining millions of XVG for free again.

If Verge will implode this time?

Source: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3256693.msg38135174#msg38135174

This is the guy who last time pointed the exploit out. Reliable source.

Edit: earliest block I found as a starting point is 2,155,913. https://prohashing.com/explorer/Verge/ still shows the current growth of the blockchain at around 25 blocks per minute resulting in 18250XVG or 950$ per minute for the attacker.

Currently sitting at around 650.000$ worth of XVG.

Edit2: official block explorer is back online, with a WAY higher blockheight, 2.205.900 is one of the last blocks from the attacker. Roughly 50.000 blocks were possibly mined from the attacker resulting in around 1.900.000$. Still not sure what to think of this sudden stop on the official explorer, will have an eye on it.

Edit3: it seems the attack is over, 35.000.000 XVG were generated in a few hours. But this also means there is still no fix and this is possible at any time again. Meanwhile the only official info out there is ""mining pools are DDoS'd"".

Since this happened I have had a very long month of speaking with Microsoft support everyday to try and retrieve my hacked email and they finally came to a conclusion. They told me to submit X information and I did, after waiting a month for a response they have said they fully acknowledge I am the account owner but with any Hotmail account that has had fraudulent activity on it what they do is indefinitely suspend the account and cannot give me access back to it. In turn I have lost a lot more then this Binance account, but almost my whole career unfortunately. But sticking to the topic of Binance they will not allow me to regain access unless I send the support ticket through the email associated with the account which is literally impossible as it has been suspended forever and no one can access it. I have the phone number, the google authenticator, the 2 step verification photos on the account are me, and prior to being locked out of the account I was instructed by a member of the Binance team named Jager to submit a photo of myself with my passport and a note that says ""Please change my email to Be\*\*\*\*\*@gmail.com"" which I did. So I have undeniable proof that I am the owner of this Binance account but they need the ticket to be submitted from the email associated with the account and Microsoft will not give anyone access to the email and has suspended it forever making this impossible. I am in the process of suing my phone provider Rogers which caused this whole problem in the first place and they have claimed full responsibility for what has happened. We are moving forward with the case very soon, so at least there is still some hope.

How to Find Assets BEFORE They Are Popular,1608,6whiyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6whiyv/how_to_find_assets_before_they_are_popular/,264,1503928388.0,"I am writing this post because a lot of people ask me... ""Where do you get your information from?"" or ""How do you discover assets before they are popular?""...  Well to put it quite simply, it's because of research. Here are my thoughts on this..

Since Jan 2017 alone there has been abundant opportunities to make great gains. When investing, research is the #1 key to becoming reliably right.

- Research would have let you known that Ripple (XRP) was working with major banks in Asia (Japan) while the asset was only half a cent. ($0.005)
https://ripple.com/insights/forty-seven-japanese-banks-move-towards-commercial-phase-using-ripple/

- Research would have informed you of the Ethereum Alliance while ETH was $20 or less.
https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/03/Enterprise-Ethereum

- Research tells you ""JPMorgan Chase To Integrate Zcash Technology To Its Enterprise Blockchain Platform."" (You'd also know that original Zcoin team left to create Zcash)
https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/05/22/jpmorgan-chase-to-integrate-zcash-technology-to-its-enterprise-blockchain-platform/

- You'd find out that NEO (AntShares) had a relationship with Alibaba when NEO was 25 cents or less.
https://siliconangle.com/blog/2016/10/20/onchain-partners-with-alibaba-for-blockchain-powered-email-evidence-repository/

I can go on and on, the point is, research and patience is the key to success.. This year alone, If you have bought those assets and held onto them, you should be doing very well today. (and that's just a handful) Keep in mind, there is no ""get rich quick"" strategy. I am also sitting on assets that have not yet shown impressive results, but are expected to establish a high earning power later.


Researching for the long-term is the key to success in this market.  Here are some additional articles I have wrote that can maybe help keep  investors in the right direction.

- Surviving The Inevitable Crypto Big Bubble
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6jd6lt/surviving_the_inevitable_crypto_big_bubble/

- Everyday is a Good Day in Crypto!
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6k8vu9/everyday_is_a_good_day_in_crypto/

- Making a Million Dollars.
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6nhl0q/making_a_million_dollars/


So back to the topic of researching..  There are many under valued assets that have a good foundation with strong relationships and partners.  Keep in mind 90-95% of crypto assets WILL fail and never succeed. The only way you can be reliably right long-term is through research. Know what you are getting into. Look for assets that have a strong foundation, favorable odds of execution, good partners and strong relationships/clients.

Don't be fooled by market prices! Just because a price on a particular asset is going up, doesn't mean it will be successful.  When the next bubble comes, (and it will) assets could drop below your purchase price and/or never recover. The only way you can ensure long-term reliability is through research and selectivity.

Here are some things to note..

- If you throw money into an asset without research, your giving your money away.
- If you are impatient, you will become indecisive and sell short or take a loss.
- If you over-spend you'll deal with anxiety, stress and become irrational.
- If your buying/selling the same asset more than twice a year; your likely doing something wrong.
- If you cant sleep because you worry about assets, your doing something wrong.
- If you don't know what to buy, you didn't research.


Here are some things I look for when investing..

- Find a promising asset.
- Find something before it's popular. (low market cap)
- Thoroughly analyze an asset and its underlying business before you buy.
- Look at financial records and/if the business is investing in themselves.
- Protect yourself against serious losses. (can it survive a worst case scenario)
- Achieve adequate performance, not extraordinary.

There are so many assets, with research you can pretty much eliminate most of them from your radar. Once you get familiar with what to look for, researching becomes easier as you go through more assets. Through process of elimination you can come up with a grade scale based on your own research findings. (see below)

- AAA (Excellent past growth that is likely to continue in the future.)
- AA (Very good past growth that is likely to continue in the future.)
- A (Good growth but has yet to show impressive results.)
- B (Not yet shown impressive results but is expected to later)
- C (High Risk, Long-Shots, 2-5% of your portfolio.)
- D (Very High Risk, 3rd World)
- F (Don't Invest)


Personally, this is how I research.

- Buy 2-3 large binders with 200 sheet protectors.
- Buy Tabs for your binders. (Each tab is graded AAA-D)
- Analyze an asset, and print a cover sheet using coinmarketcap.
- Print information/news you find and index it behind your cover sheet.
- Continue to research and arrange your assets by grade.
- Add/Make adjustments to your portfolio through ongoing research.
- Start to determine which assets are undervalued based on your research. 

Now everyone has there own way of doing research. Perhaps i'm a Flintstone but this is just the method that I find works for me. This method allows me to look back at articles/news I printed without trying to remember every detail. I can also easily go through the grades and remind myself where an asset compares to others. I can even move assets into a different grade scale or pass a copy to a friend to look at. In addition, it's fun.. When I research something new for the first time, I am always curious where it will rank in the portfolio compared to other assets. When all is said and done, you'll have a better idea where to put your money. 
Just remember the key to long-term selectivity is research and patience.

Everyone should really relax! Here’s why! (From a PhD student in Economics working on a dissertation that is about Crypto),1566,85a20i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/85a20i/everyone_should_really_relax_heres_why_from_a_phd/,666,1521389754.0,"If you’re worried about the price, don’t be. 

I have been in the crypto-sphere since about 2014-ish. I originally bought my bitcoin for use on the internet. 

That was what started me on the path to studying and understanding how blockchain works and why it is such a huge deal.

Blockchain’s main purpose is to securely transfer value without the need for an intermediary. This isn’t a stock or a traditional investment. In fact it’s something that’s never been seen in the history of the world. Throughout the history of money one would need SOME 3rd party (Gov., banks, etc...) to verify a transaction or to give the currency value. Blockchain, or more specifically cryptocurrency completely eliminates this aspect of currency. 

That being said, there is no assets or company backing (some exceptions) any crypto on the market. There is no earnings report that estimates the value; there is no technical analysis in the world that can predict the price; there is no relationship between a stock/bond and a cryptocurrency. 

These virtual assets are a utility. 

Utility in economics is the amount of time and money you save by choosing a certain financial path. For day to day consumers we want to maximize our utility I.e. get the most bang for our buck. Large corporations and governments would like to minimize it to cut out whatever that is not needed to increase the bottom line on their income statement. 

These currencies not only allow society to easily optimize utility for large entities, but for individuals as well. 

Corporations that solely exist to transfer/store value (visa, western union, Wells Fargo, etc...) marginally decrease our optimal utility and suck the liquidity out of an economy. I don’t want to seem like I am attacking these corporations but this is literally the definition of a parasite. Which is an entity that receives benefits from a host while the host is in detriment. These corporations leech this money out of the economy. Sure their workers are paid and this increases their marginal prosperity to consume, but how many jobs are lost to efforts of cost reduction? How much investment is left on the sidelines due to fees and other stipulations these intermediaries create? 

If this leakage of utility and liquidity is patched our global economy will operate at a greater efficiency than it currently is; as there is no forced induction of funds into an industry that’s only function is to transfer/store value. 

Since its established that this IS the future of finance, based on my extremely simplified explanation, the only question now is the question of rate of adoption. 

I have 3 brief points to make:

 1.) Adoption curves do exist and they are found in a every thing that is used today. Cars, phones, the internet, Reddit, etc. All of these utilities follow the adoption curve ([or S-curve](http://i2.wp.com/www.business-planning-for-managers.com/Worpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/adoption_curve.jpg)) almost 1:1. 
 
 2.) Fractals are a branch of mathematics that explain the bigger picture by looking at smaller portions of the whole. (“As above, so below”) This is rather difficult to explain, but it is basically repetition that grows with scale.  

 3.) Crypto is nowhere near full adoption, we are in the mania phase of early adoption where all the applications of the technology are being tried and vetted for use in the world. This aspect is known as the Gartner Hype Cycle.
With these points, one puts together a puzzle. [Since Crypto is so volatile and there is little knowledge in the world of it, along with patterns of repetition that appear to be fractal,](https://i.imgur.com/05V81cb.png) we know this is only the beginning of a revolution. 

I believe we are in the beginning stages of the FIRST investable adoption curve to ever face humanity and the research I have gathered thus far supports this thesis immaculately.

I know seeing these prices short-term hurt you greatly and it feels terrible thinking you made a bad choice. But time heals all and you and I will be the winners in the end. 

This is the internet of value being created right in front of us. In fact blockchain will do to finance, what the internet did for telecommunications.

Invest in fundamentals, believe in yourself, understand the technology, and don’t ever listen to the media (banks have a lot of money to spread fear to eliminate a threat). 

Sometime this year, we will have another bull run, and this one will not be as large percentage wise. But the value in fiat will be exponentially increased. 



Much love, good luck, and HODL.

P.s. sorry about any errors I’m on mobile and it’s 2 am and I just finished working on a paper.

On 31st October 2008, the bitcoin whitepaper was released by the creator of bitcoin under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has been a mystery for a decade, many suspects have come up, but no one is sure. Amidst all this confusion, Craig Wright, a known fraud has forged many documents, including submitting a fake email in a billion dollar lawsuit, has claimed the throne of Satoshi Nakamoto, and when confronted with proof of the claim, has always only given forged documents. A few days ago he crossed the line by filing a copyright for the bitcoin whitepaper, considered sacred for many, this has caused many gullible people to invest in the so called ""real bitcoin"", Bitcoin SV, by making Craig Wright, the creator of Bitcoin SV look like Satoshi. This is an extremely unethical act conducted by Craig and the real Satoshi cant even dispute the claim as he has been and probably wants to continue stay anonymous.

Ethereum is undervalued and presents a compelling investment opportunity for the mid-to-long term,1547,cf88h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/cf88h3/ethereum_is_undervalued_and_presents_a_compelling/,915,1563575358.0,"I believe in the current market, ETH is priced irrationally low versus Bitcoin and presents a compelling buying opportunity.  Bitcoin does have the liquidity and volume advantage, but Ethereum will start to gain against it as futures and other financial products (most of which are exclusively Bitcoin right now) start to expand to Ethereum.

If you look at most of the streamlined crypto financial reporting tools, the focus tends to be on Bitcoin and Ethereum- pretty much ignoring anything else.  If you view these entities as a leading indicator for the broader market, they are telling us that *Ethereum is and will remain a major financial asset in the crypto space, very likely to increase in public awareness over time*.  And of course, ETH is one of only two cryptoassets I'm aware of which the SEC has explicitly deemed a non-security (the other is BTC), which gives it important regulatory treatment which will encourage the creation of more US-based financial products based upon it.

This isn't just a first place ""gold"" (BTC) and second place ""silver"" (ETH) comparison though.  ETH is like a ""silver"" which will only continue to get better and more useful over time, while BTC is a digital gold which will remain relatively stagnant and will likely only have as much relevance as the commodity it now seeks to emulate.  *And Ethereum has one advantage Bitcoin will never have- diverse and trust-minimized / trust-less financial and non-financial use cases.*

ETH is not only used as money today in the decentralized Ethereum economy, but Ethereum is used to create, store, and interact with all sorts of financial assets, and much of that activity which would not be possible without it.  *Watch over the next 5 years as Ethereum begins to devour more and more assets onto the chain.  It started with ETH, then ERC-20s, then NFT / digital collectibles, then stable coins, and now onto tokenized securities and even tokenized BTC in the form of WBTC.  As that happens, economic activity on Ethereum will begin to skyrocket, compared to Bitcoin which is effectively a mono-asset market.*

And over a 10 to 20 year timeframe, I'm willing to bet that the asset which actually allows for native decentralized finance (that's ETH) has a decent shot at becoming a broadly accepted money, versus something whose monetary premium is derived essentially from memes only (that's BTC).

*Ethereum is a massive sleeper at #2 with much room to grow, and much world changing potential still to come.*  And right now, it's trading at only 12.5% or 1/8th of the BTC marketcap.  Unless you're one of those people who believe BTC dominance is going to 95% and all other assets will die, this is a very compelling discount for a savvy investor.

Very few other chains provide any meaningful economic value to the space, which is why I believe most financial value will accrue to ETH and BTC over time. That's why I remain about 80% ETH and 20% BTC, and continue to be very optimistic about Ethereum and ETH's future.",2019-07-20 06:29:18

[Full blog post](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-2019-month-seven-xknveq)

tl;dr - July was a down month, but still up +74% in 2019. Bitcoin wins the month, overall Litecoin holds the smallest of leads, all cryptos in positive territory for the year except Stellar and XRP.

# The Experiment:

Instead of hypothetically tracking cryptos,[ I made an actual $1000 investment, $100 in each of the Top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap as of the 1st of January 2018](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-two-years-2018-2-xomekw). ***I then repeated the experiment on the 1st of January 2019***. Think of it as a lazy man's Index Fund (no weighting or rebalancing), less technical, more fun (for me at least), and hopefully still a proxy for the market as a whole - or at the very least an interesting snapshot of the 2019 crypto space. Trying to keep it simple and accessible for beginners and those looking to get into crypto but maybe not quite ready to jump in yet.

# The Rules:

Buy $100 of each the Top 10 cryptocurrencies on January 1st, 2019. Run the experiment two years. Hold only. No selling. No trading. Report monthly. Compare loosely to the [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-two-years-2018-2-xomekw).

# Month Seven - Up 74%

July hit the 2019 Top Ten portfolio hard, with a nearly -40% drop since the end of June. All cryptos are in the red except **Bitcoin and Tether**. June showed sideways movement, but July decisively breaks the five month win streak (or more preciously, a four-month-win-plus-one-month-sideways streak). That said, the 2019 Top Ten portfolio is still up +74% on the year.

Lots of movement this month. All of the Top Ten cryptos moved except **Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple**. Of note, **Litecoin** and **Bitcoin Cash** which switched places with each other again, **Stellar** reclaimed its spot in the Top Ten, and **EOS** dropped two spots to #8.

**Tron** is now alone as the only Top Ten dropout and has been replaced by **Binance Coin**.

***July Winners*** \- **Bitcoin**, easily. All others (except **Tether**) were down double digits, with most falling over -20%.

***July Losers*** \- **Tron**, easily, losing nearly 1/3rd of its value, down -32% in July. **EOS** had a rough month too, dropping -26% and two places in the rankings.

For those keeping score, here is tally of which coins have the most monthly wins and loses during the first seven months of this experiment: **Bitcoin** distinguished itself from the pack this month by achieving its second monthly victory of the year. **Bitcoin SV** still has the most monthly loses: three out of the first seven months.

# Overall update – Litecoin holds the smallest of leads, all cryptos in positive territory except Stellar and Ripple

Similar to last month, although **Bitcoin** makes the headlines, it's actually **Litecoin** that continues to perform best, up +214% on the year. My initial $100 investment in **Litecoin** is now worth $321. But for the second month in a row, **Bitcoin** made up a ton of ground, finishing July just a few percentage points behind **Litecoin**.

**Stellar** is at the bottom, down -28% so far in 2019, followed by **Ripple**, down -10%.

# Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

https://preview.redd.it/y6pm81g64ne31.png?width=434&format=png&auto=webp&s=e70fd60bd3e529338c0dc7b8ffd9c97a3151384a

For the first time since February, the total crypto market cap decreased, losing about $13B in July. Still, the overall market cap remains over $300B, an increase of +143% since the beginning of 2019.

# Bitcoin dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/79c40ey84ne31.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=474612060993e8ef2ba616df00a97445dc7c7afb

**Bitcoin** dominance leaped again in July, and now is close to 68%. This sets another record for **Bitcoin** dominance so far in the 2019 and[ 2018 Top Ten Experiments](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-two-years-2018-2-xomekw).

# Overall return on investment from January 1st, 2019:

https://preview.redd.it/aizrumub4ne31.png?width=277&format=png&auto=webp&s=b00544202d688353d7c7d52d83ef0a69864d99d1

In July I saw my overall return shrink by about $400, quite a hit. If I cashed out today, my $1,000 initial investment would return $1,744, a +74% gain. Not at all bad compared to the stock market: the return I would have received from investing that same $1000 on January 1st, 2019 in the the S&P 500 is about +17%, same as last month (see below).

# Implications/Observations:

Although the overall market ended down on the month, it's still up 143% on the year. What's noteworthy this month is the absolute chasm that's opened between the performance of the market overall and the Top Ten cryptos that I started with at the beginning of 2019. My Top Ten group? Up 74%. That's only half the return of the overall market. Remember, in May, the gains from the Top Ten and the entire market were both exactly the same amount: +114%. This month, not even close. For two straight months, focusing only on the Top Ten has been a losing strategy. This is reminiscent of last year as [at no point in the Top Ten 2018 Experiment did the Top Ten strategy outperform the overall market](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-two-years-2018-2-xomekw).

I'm also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options. The S&P 500 was flat in July, still up +17% since the beginning of 2019. Solid gains, but of course nothing like what we've seen in crypto so far this year. The initial $1k investment I put into crypto would have yielded +$170 had it been redirected to the S&P compared to the $744 I'm currently up with the 2019 Top Ten Cryptos.

# Conclusion:

July was an obvious down month for crypto. I've been a bit delayed on the update this month so as I'm putting this together, crypto's been on a bit of an upward run, with **Bitcoin** looking like it's about to test $12k. The monthly nature of these updates prevents me from getting caught up in the daily fluctuations of the crypto market and allows a bit of perspective.  Taking a step back, it looks, at this point at least, like July was a bit of a speedbump, but by no means signals a crypto bear market - the overall trend of the first half of 2019 is unmistakably positive.

If you're just finding this experiment now, here's the backstory: On the 1st of January, 2018, I bought $100 each of the Top Ten cryptos at the time for a total investment of $1000 to see how they would perform over the year. I tracked the experiment and reported each month. The result? [I ended 2018 down -85%, my $1000 worth only $150.](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-for-one-year-2018-final-report-for-2018-down-85-xlol)

After last year's experiment ended, I decided to do two things:

1. Extend the Top Ten 2018 Crypto project one more year. The experiment is now in its 19th month. You can check out the latest update [here](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-two-years-2018-2-xomekw).
2. What you're reading now is the 7th report of a parallel project: this year I repeated the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) of the new Top Ten cryptos as of January 1st, 2019.

Thanks for reading and the support for the experiment. I hope you’ve found it helpful. I continue to be committed to seeing this process through and reporting along the way. Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports.",2019-08-06 06:50:36

"January 14th 2018, almost one year ago was the last day everything was normal to me",1535,afham0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/afham0/january_14th_2018_almost_one_year_ago_was_the/,133,1547395085.0,"(This turned out to be a extremely long post, I hope anyone will read it. I had to get this off my chest.)

&#x200B;

As the crypto market is still stumbling and trying to recover it just hit me...

&#x200B;

January 14th last year was my last day everything was normal to me.

&#x200B;

I invested in crypto for the first time in May 2017. Bought some more in the following months, I eventually poured in 90% of my savings. Then we bought a house in August of 2017, we'd get the key halfway in November. Tons and tons of work had/has to be done in this house, so I really started focussing on crypto. Me and my wife were also expecting twins, so I HAD to get certain things done before June 2018..

&#x200B;

I went up 60% of my investment in a few days when CFD (Confido) boomed. I was lucky enough to be there on Etherdelta when it became available, bought the first loads people sold after ICO. Took me a few hours of trading, but I had profit! Instantly cashed the profit, because we had to pay a few K's before I could get the key, so I was close to fucked but I just made it out alive. Especially as I saw they exit scammed and I saw my portfolio drop by nearly 70%, but luckily I had the money I needed.

&#x200B;

In the next months I made some good choices, bought Snovio at 0.004 cents and saw it raise to 40 cents I believe, my investment wasn't huge but the return was insane. Could have much bigger, but I sold slowly as it kept rising to be safe. Other big coins were Raiblocks, Oyster Pearl. Crypto took over my life, every waking hour I was trading / reading / looking up on coins I could invest in etc. I saw a growth I could not imagine, I had about 2000 in and saw it grow to 32-35k. Cashed out a bit, saw prices drop, invested again and so on. It was insane because I was doing 3-4000 trades and sending so much money around all the time, I had the time of my life. 

&#x200B;

Naturally I had a cash out goal because this entire project was to fund our renovation of the house, which is about 50-60k. As, I think, any human being seeing my investment grow so much I dreamed much further. At 30-32k I decided I HAD to cash out because this was not substainable, it went up way too fast for my liking and almost everything did in my portfolio. Our life was pretty good, without cashing out crypto we were able to live pretty good. We could go out for dinner atleast twice a month, spend money on things we liked and still have leftovers.

&#x200B;

I decided to cash out on January the 14th of 2018. I couldn't at the time, though. I had been working and was chilling with my boss and some other people in a bar (I work in a restaurant, so happens fairly often). Tomorrow I would go and cash out, take my money and see how it'll go.

&#x200B;

On monday January the 15th we had to get our scan at the hospital to see how the kids were doing, had to go there every 2 weeks. We'd finally learn about the gender! Went there in the morning. The nurse seemed troubled, went to find another nurse to check again. The legs were too short of both of our children and there were some other things I can't even remember, we had to go to a specialized hospital to further investigate. Sadly we had to wait until Friday the 19th... One thing was sure though, something was horribly wrong.

&#x200B;

Of course we were completely crushed, I felt like our entire world just collapsed. Luckily we have family that instantly came to us to talk about it. I saw my wife go from the happiest person on earth to being deeply depressed. We held on to the thought hospitals can make mistakes, everything will be fine..

&#x200B;

Friday the 19th came and they took 20 minutes listing the faults of the kids.. Except she said 'now I have to check the other kid..'. That took 10 minutes and I told the nurse to stop. Both kids had a skeleton abnormality (I hope google translate did that properly), some organs weren't on the right place, arms/legs were too short, most feet/hands did not have 5 fingers (some had 7 or 3). 

&#x200B;

They had no chance of survival, January 31 they were born dead. We had them cremated a few weeks later.

&#x200B;

Damage had been done.. Our world was messed up, it was one huge haze and I honestly wish I'd wake up from this nightmare. I completely forgot about my coins, on January the 15th my portfolio started dropping too I found out later.. And rapidly. I think I checked it around january 25th. Not all was lost, though. I was able to take a month off work and continued some work in the house (I just had to do something), paid by crypto. Throughout the next few months I was able to pay out a few K's here and there, I think I paid out about 600% of my investment but I still lost like 22k of that portfolio growth.

&#x200B;

I was extremely strong for my wife for the next months, when she crawled out of her depressiong around may 2018 I started feeling bad. Halfway in june I was at work and completely lost what I was doing, already had some anger issues (suddenly exploding towards people). Then I got a panic attack and this was it. I went home and went to a doc, it was a burnout. The 6 months after this have been hell, I went through extreme depression. I couldn't get groceries, couldn't handle full rooms of people, had trouble getting even out of bed because I was extremely tired and anger issues (I destroyed 2 of my PC desks, punched a hole in the wall and stuff like that. Nothing towards my wife thank god). 

&#x200B;

After that came thoughts of that I should commit suicide, because I had no life. Thankfully I could never do this to my family and I wouldn't even dare to make that final step. But the thoughts were there. Even though it has been my job now for 15 years, I couldn't even cook anymore. Gaming has always been my number one hobby, that brought no joy. I isolated myself, but thank god I have family that forced me to open the door or go to them.

&#x200B;

Next to that came the expenses which have been on-going since February last year. We got hit by some big bills, when I got sick in january that took a pretty big hit in my salary. I now have a little over 700 of crypto, absolutely no money in the bank (minus, even). Can't buy anything I enjoy because we're still struggling from the disaster that was 2018. I still need 50k at least for the house, but maybe one day..

&#x200B;

Fast forward to december, this was my turning point I think. Went to a therapist and found out work stress was also a major issue. I've been getting progressively better since the first week of december. I quit my job in that week. I'm talking major steps in the right direction and I'm feeling better almost every day.

&#x200B;

Tomorrow the 14th of january will be my first day at my new job and I couldn't be more excited.

&#x200B;

The point of my post is that I see so many people stress/worry about their coins/investment. I even see people fight to defend the coins they believe is the best and protecting them to no end. 

&#x200B;

While money is a handy thing to have, I am absolutely fine with where I am. We're struggling as I mentioned above, but just feeling better is worth more than a million dollars. I learned the value of other things than money. I was able to take a month off work to be here for my wife, without crypto none of that was possible. While the crypto money had a completely different destination, I could not be happier on what I have spend whatever I cashed out on.

&#x200B;

Remember that your portfolio could raise insanely fast in the future (or drop...), but stay sane. There are far more important things in life, don't invest more than you can afford to lose and you should be ok. Don't lose sleep over your coins, don't be stressed. It can all be fun and glory until you get smashed from a completely different direction like I told you above.

&#x200B;

For those who made it this far, thank you for reading. This was a tough post for me, I had to get it off my chest..

&#x200B;

Edit: Wow I’m overwhelmed by the amount of posts/PMs! I read them all but it’s impossible to respond to everyone.

It might be unclear, I got a few hostile PMs about this which I won’t even bother to respond to; I pulled out about 250-300% profit on my crypto investment so this isn’t quite the tragic investment story you make it seem to be. In fact, I’d be far worse off if I didn’t make the investment at all !",2019-01-13 23:58:05

I remember the hype started when John McAffe (the ""celeb"" who gets paid for his tweets) tweeted about it, and it's been a shitshow ever since. And the dumb money KEEPS FLOWING IN.

 * Back in November/December, McAffe tweets about Verge (probably got his $105,000.00 for that). Hype starts building up.
 * Verge had a ""Wraith Protocol"" update coming up on a set date. Dev didn't keep true to his word and postponned it. When it finally came out, it wasn't anything impressive.
 * Dev made a post asking about paying taxes related to cryptos/coinbase. A few hours after said post, he started a ""Give Verge to our pool so we can reveal big news on day XX/YY!!!1""
 * Didn't get enough money, some company matched the donation value so he would reveal it anyway. 
 * Didn't reveal it. Postponned to April 16th.
 * Two days ago, their Blockchain was hacked.
 * Dev pushed a ""fix"" and said everything was fine. Wasn't, as hacker still mined free XVG.
 * Now Dev pushed another ""fix"". It was a hardfork. He didn't know it was a hardfork. Let me repeat that. The Dev. Didn't. Know. He. Pushed. A. Hard. Fork.

Despite all this, XVG is riding a pretty substantial rocket in value, gaining crazy percentages in a consolidated bear market. This honestly feels JUST LIKE BITCONNECT. Dumb money flows in, colorblind to all the red flags that keep popping up and probably thinking they're gray or green.


I'm at a loss for words. If anyone knows an exchange that allows me to short Verge, please PM it to me. I'll love some free money when this shit booms.",2018-04-07 18:04:34

Request is what I envisioned after getting into Bitcoin in mid 2010. Request is the crypto vision.,1510,7nyzxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7nyzxs/request_is_what_i_envisioned_after_getting_into/,244,1515053599.0,"When I first heard of Bitcoin, I was very interested. I'd been working for a large, very well-known company, and I immediately saw practical use cases for Bitcoin, but I knew that it had a long way to go before it would get to that point. I knew they would laugh at Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin made me wealthy, but I was doing well before Bitcoin. For me it was a philosophical search for something better than our current system. Something better than what the for-profit bankers had concocted. I saw how the rich siphoned money from the poor because the poor had no other choices. The rich rule this world.  

Over the years, Bitcoin has morphed into something else - digital gold - which is fine by me. Bitcoin is solid. Bitcoin is strong. Bitcoin isn't going away. But Bitcoin is not very experimental. 

Ethereum came along, and I was again intrigued. But yet again, I knew it had a long way to go. 

Still, I envisioned this massive network of nearly instantaneous payments that connected every business to every person. I envisioned a  B2B, P2P, crowdfunding, and point-of-sale network that was massive, worldwide, and connected. I envisioned an open-source, transparent network. I envisioned the inevitable future of commerce. 

The Request Network is what I envisioned. 

[REQ Map](https://www.mindmeister.com/991002501?t=R1iofDilV0)

But this isn't about making money. We all may make money, but that isn't the reason we are doing this. We are doing this to bring the whole world a new system. A system devoid of the predatory bankers and middlemen. A system where John in Africa is on the same playing field as Dave in Chicago. 

We are here to disrupt. We are here to fight the powers that rule this world - the powers that are slowly destroying this planet in the name of profit. 

Ethereum and Request are the just the first steps. Go out there and use your cryptos. Spend them. Trade them. Make these bankers take note. This is a revolution.

Update:I've compiled a few coins and I'm setting up pooled mining right now. I'll briefly go over how I did all this on stream but I'm doing it beforehand because it takes a long time to compile  coin (like a half hour) and it takes hours for the wallets to sync.

Thank you to everyone who has donated.  I have like $800 total now so we can attack a few coins. Thank you to everyone who has donated.

&#x200B;

Edit: I think I’ll do it in like a week against a small coin like Einsteinium or the like. I might also set it up so if you donate a dollar to the stream you can send me some text that I’ll throw into my forked chains overriding transaction and give that money to the EFF (and pay for the minimal cost of renting hashing power). Stay tuned.

I'm considering doing a live stream of all the setup and execution of doing a 51% attack against against the bitcoin testnet so that people can see how it works in real life, not in theory. I'd also discuss how the attack works and every concept encountered along the way. I'd also talk about the security implications and how some coins go about preventing such attacks, the pros and cons of such tactics, etc.

Edit: Could also just attack a small cap coin. That would let me get into some interesting game theory from an attackers perspective about what coins they want to attack, what exchanges, in what order, and what would deter them. Which is equally interesting. One thing people don't often mention is the importance of the depth of a given coins trading books because with many coins there is so little liquidity that an attacker could only sell a few thousand dollars worth of the coin before crashing its price and making subsequent cycles of the attack hard.

*Marketing*.

It's a dirty word for most members of the Monero community.

It is also one of the most divisive words in the Monero community. Yet, the lack of marketing is one of the most frustrating things for many newcomers.

This is what makes this an unusual post from a member of the Monero community. 

This post is an unabashed and unsolicited analyzation of why I believe Monero to have great potential.

Below I have attempted to outline different reasons why Monero has great potential, beginning with upcoming developments and use cases, to broader economic motives, speculation, and key issues for it to overcome.

I encourage you to discuss and criticise my musings, commenting below if you feel necessary to do so. 




##**///Upcoming Developments///**

**Bulletproofs - A Reduction in Transaction Sizes and Fees**

Since the introduction of Ring Confidential Transactions (Ring CT), transaction amounts have been hidden in Monero, albeit at the cost of increased transaction fees and sizes. In order to mitigate this issue, Bulletproofs will soon be added to [reduce both fees and transaction size by 80% to 90%](https://getmonero.org/2017/12/07/Monero-Compatible-Bulletproofs.html). This is great news for those transacting smaller USD amounts as people commonly complained Monero's fees were too high! Not any longer though! [More information can be found here](https://getmonero.org/2017/12/11/A-note-on-fees.html). Bulletproofs are already working on the Monero testnet, and developers were aiming to introduce them in March 2018, however it could be delayed in order to ensure everything is tried and tested. 

**Multisig**

[Multisig has recently been merged!](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/2134) Mulitsig, also called multisignature, is the requirement for a transaction to have two or more signatures before it can be executed. Multisig transactions and addresses are indistinguishable from normal transactions and addresses in Monero, and provide more security than single-signature transactions. It is believed this will lead to additional marketplaces and exchanges to supporting Monero.

**Kovri**

[Kovri](https://getkovri.org/) is an implementation of the Invisible Internet Project (I2P) network. Kovri uses both garlic encryption and garlic routing to create a private, protected overlay-network across the internet. This overlay-network provides users with the ability to effectively hide their geographical location and internet IP address. The good news is Kovri is under heavy development and will be available soon. Unlike other coins' false privacy claims, Kovri is a game changer as it will further elevate Monero as the king of privacy.

**Mobile Wallets**

There is already a working [Android Wallet called Monerujo](https://monerujo.io/) available in the Google Play Store. [X Wallet](https://xwallet.tech/) is an IOS mobile wallet. One of the X Wallet developers [recently announced](https://twitter.com/rusticbison/status/951760058131664896) they are very, very close to being listed in the Apple App Store, however are having some [issues with getting it approved](https://twitter.com/rusticbison/status/953619818602729473). The official Monero IOS and Android wallets, along with the MyMonero IOS and Android wallets, are also almost ready to be released, and can be expected very soon.

**Hardware Wallets** 

Hardware wallets are currently being developed and nearing completion. Because Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol, it means it requires unique development in order to allow hardware wallet integration. The [Ledger Nano S will be adding Monero support by the end of Q1 2018](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7kwbf9/ledger_to_have_monero_support_before_end_of_q1/). [There is a recent update here too.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7pfj0z/ledger_hardware_wallet_monero_integration_some/) Even better, for the first time ever in cryptocurrency history, the Monero community banded together to fund the development of an exclusive Monero Hardware Wallet, and will be available in Q2 2018, costing [only about $20!](https://btcmanager.com/monero-hardware-wallet-prototype-announced-at-34c3/) In addition, [the CEO of Trezor has offered a 10BTC bounty](https://twitter.com/slushcz/status/932632838435782658) to whoever can provide the software to allow Monero integration. Someone can be seen to [already be working on that here](https://github.com/dominik-selmeci/monero-python-poc). 

**TAILS  Operating System Integration**

Monero is in the progress of being packaged in order for it to be integrated into [TAILS](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/2395) and ready to use upon install. TAILS is the operating system popularised by Edward Snowden and is commonly used by those requiring privacy such as [journalists wanting to protect themselves and sources, human-right defenders organizing in repressive contexts, citizens facing national emergencies, domestic violence survivors escaping from their abusers](https://tails.boum.org/news/who_are_you_helping/index.en.html), and consequently, darknet market users.

In the meantime, for those users who wish to use TAILS with Monero, u/Electric_sheep01 has provided [Sheep's Noob guide to Monero GUI in Tails 3.2](https://medium.com/@Electricsheep56/sheeps-noob-guide-to-monero-gui-in-tails-3-2-d75c4e829c17), which is a step-by-step guide with screenshots explaining how to setup Monero in TAILS, and is very easy to follow.

**Mandatory Hardforks** 

Unlike other coins, Monero receives a protocol upgrade every 6 months in March and September. Think of it as a *Consensus Protocol Update*. Monero's hard forks ensure quality development takes place, while preventing political or ideological issues from hindering progress. When a hardfork occurs, you simply download and use the new daemon version, and your existing wallet files and copy of the blockchain remain compatible. [This reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6yprar/mandatory_upgrade_monero_01100_helium_hydra/) provides more information.

**Dynamic fees** 

Many cryptocurrencies have an arbitrary block size limit. Although Monero has a limit, it is adaptive based on the past 100 blocks. Similarly, fees change based on transaction volume. As more transactions are processed on the Monero network, the block size limit slowly increases and the fees slowly decrease. The opposite effect also holds true. This means that the more transactions that take place, the cheaper the fees!

**Tail Emission and Inflation**

There will be around 18.4 million Monero mined at the end of May 2022. However, tail emission will kick in after that which is 0.6 XMR, so it has no fixed limit. [Gundamlancer explains](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/4205/what-is-the-total-supply-of-monero-and-when-will-it-be-finished-mining) that Monero's *""main emission curve will issue about 18.4 million coins to be mined in approximately 8 years. (more precisely 18.132 Million coins by ca. end of May 2022) After that, a constant ""tail emission"" of 0.6 XMR per 2-minutes block (modified from initially equivalent 0.3 XMR per 1-minute block) will create a sub-1% perpetual inflatio starting with 0.87% yearly inflation around May 2022) to prevent the lack of incentives for miners once a currency is not mineable anymore.*

**Monero Research Lab** 

Monero has a group of anonymous/pseudo-anonymous university academics actively researching, developing, and publishing academic papers in order to improve Monero. See [here](https://lab.getmonero.org/) and [here](https://github.com/b-g-goodell/research-lab). The Monero Research Lab are acquainted with other members of cryptocurrency academic community to ensure when new research or technology is uncovered, it can be reviewed and decided upon whether it would be beneficial to Monero. This ensures Monero will always remain a leading cryptocurrency. A recent end of 2017 update from a MRL researcher can be found [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7r3lvu/suraes_delayed_end_of_december_update/).




##**///Monero's Technology - Rising Above The Rest///**

**Monero Has Already Proven Itself To Be Private, Secure, Untraceable, and Trustless** 

Monero is the only private, untraceable, trustless, secure and fungible cryptocurrency. [Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are TRACEABLE through the use of blockchain analytics](http://www.trustnodes.com/2018/01/09/bitfury-de-anonymises-millions-bitcoin-transactions-addresses), and has lead to the prosecution of numerous individuals, such as the alleged [Alphabay administrator Alexandre Cazes](https://news.bitcoin.com/the-curious-cases-of-the-alphabay-kingpin-and-hansa-takedowns/). In the [Forfeiture Complaint which detailed the asset seizure of Alexandre Cazes](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/982821/download), the anonymity capabilities of Monero were self-demonstrated by the following statement of the officials after the AlphaBay shutdown: *""In total, from CAZES' wallets and computer agents took control of approximately $8,800,000 in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero and Zcash, broken down as follows: 1,605.0503851 Bitcoin, 8,309.271639 Ethereum, 3,691.98 Zcash, and an unknown amount of Monero""*. 

Privacy CANNOT BE OPTIONAL and must be at a PROTOCOL LEVEL. With Monero, privacy is mandatory, so that everyone gets the benefits of privacy without any transactions standing out as suspicious. This is the reason Darknet Market places are moving to Monero, and will never use Verge, Zcash, Dash, Pivx, Sumo, Spectre, Hush or any other coins that lack good privacy. Peter Todd (who was involved in the Zcash trusted setup ceremony) recently [reiterated his concerns]( https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/937929196688592896) of optional privacy after Jeffrey Quesnelle published his [recent paper]( http://jeffq.com/blog/on-the-linkability-of-zcash-transactions/) stating 31.5% of Zcash transactions may be traceable, and that only ~1% of the transactions are pure privacy transactions (i.e., z -> z transactions). When the attempted private transactions stand out like a sore thumb there is no privacy, hence why privacy cannot be optional. In addition, in order for a cryptocurrency to truly be private, it must not be controlled by a centralised body, such as a company or organisation, because it opens it up to government control and restrictions. This is no joke, [but Zcash is supported by DARPA and the Israeli government!](http://zerocash-project.org/about_us). 

Monero provides a stark contrast compared to other supposed privacy coins, in that Monero does not have a rich list! With all other coins, you can view wallet balances on the blockexplorers. [You can view Monero's non-existent rich list here](https://moneroblocks.info/richlist) to see for yourself.

I will reiterate here that Monero is TRUSTLESS. You don't need to rely on anyone else to protect your privacy, or worry about others colluding to learn more about you. No one can censor your transaction or decide to intervene. Monero is immutable, unlike [Zcash, in which the lead developer Zooko publicly tweeted the possibility of providing a backdoor for authorities to trace transactions](https://twitter.com/zooko/status/863202798883577856). To Zcash's demise, Zooko famously tweeted:

>"" And by the way, I think we can successfully make Zcash too traceable for criminals like WannaCry, but still completely private & fungible. …""

Ethereum's track record of immutability is also poor. Ethereum was supposed to be an immutable blockchain ledger, however after the DAO hack this proved to not be the case. [A 2016 article on Saintly Law](http://www.saintylaw.com.au/2016/10/12/lessons-learned-dao-hack-blockchain-smart-contracts-security/) summarised the problematic nature of Ethereum's leadership and blockchain intervention:

>"" Many ethereum and blockchain advocates believe that the intervention was the wrong move to make in this situation. Smart contracts are meant to be self-executing, immutable and free from disturbance by organisations and intermediaries. Yet the building block of all smart contracts, the code, is inherently imperfect. This means that the technology is vulnerable to the same malicious hackers that are targeting businesses and governments. It is also clear that the large scale intervention after the DAO hack could not and would not likely be taken in smaller transactions, as they greatly undermine the viability of the cryptocurrency and the technology.""




**Monero provides Fungibility and Privacy in a Cashless World**

As outlined on [GetMonero.org]( https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/fungibility.html), fungibility is the property of a currency whereby two units can be substituted in place of one another. Fungibility means that two units of a currency can be mutually substituted and the substituted currency is equal to another unit of the same size. For example, two $10 bills can be exchanged and they are functionally identical to any other $10 bill in circulation (although $10 bills have unique ID numbers and are therefore not completely fungible). Gold is probably a closer example of true fungibility, where any 1 oz. of gold of the same grade is worth the same as another 1 oz. of gold. Monero is fungible due to the nature of the currency which provides no way to link transactions together nor trace the history of any particular XMR. 1 XMR is functionally identical to any other 1 XMR. Fungibility is an advantage Monero has over Bitcoin and almost every other cryptocurrency, due to the privacy inherent in the Monero blockchain and the permanently traceable nature of the Bitcoin blockchain. With Bitcoin, any BTC can be tracked by anyone back to its creation coinbase transaction. Therefore, if a coin has been used for an illegal purpose in the past, this history will be contained in the blockchain in perpetuity. 

A great example of [Bitcoin's lack of fungibility was reposted]( https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6uldp2/monero_privacy_is_not_a_crime_or_something_to/dlto4fn/) by u/ViolentlyPeaceful: 

>""Imagine you sell cupcakes and receive Bitcoin as payment. It turns out that someone who owned that Bitcoin before you was involved in criminal activity. Now you are worried that you have become a suspect in a criminal case, because the movement of funds to you is a matter of public record. You are also worried that certain Bitcoins that you thought you owned will be considered ‘tainted’ and that others will refuse to accept them as payment."" 

This lack of fungibility means that certain businesses will be obligated to avoid accepting BTC that have been previously used for purposes which are illegal, or simply run afoul of their Terms of Service. Currently some large Bitcoin companies are blocking, suspending, or closing accounts that have received Bitcoin used in online gambling or other purposes deemed unsavory by said companies. Monero has been built specifically to address the problem of traceability and non-fungibility inherent in other cryptocurrencies. By having completely private transactions Monero is truly fungible and there can be no blacklisting of certain XMR, while at the same time providing all the benefits of a secure, decentralized, permanent blockchain. 

The world is moving cashless. Fact. The ramifications of this are enormous as we move into a cashless world in which transactions will be tracked and [there is a potential for data to be used by third parties for adverse purposes](http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2114086/cashless-society-would-destroy-our-privacy-and-freedom). While most new cryptocurrency investors speculate upon vaporware ICO tokens in the hope of generating wealth, Monero provides salvation for those in which financial privacy is paramount. Too often people equate Monero's features with criminal endeavors. Privacy is not a crime, and is necessary for good money. Transparency in Monero is possible OFF-CHAIN, which offers greater transparency and flexibility. For example, a Monero user may share their *Private View Key* with their accountant for tax purposes. 

Monero aims to be adopted by more than just those with nefarious use cases. For example, if you lived in an oppressive religious regime and wanted to buy a certain item, using Monero would allow you to exchange value privately and across borders if needed. Another example is that if everybody can see how much cryptocurrency you have in your wallet, then a certain service might decide to charge you more, and bad actors could even use knowledge of your wallet balance to target you for extortion purposes. For example, [a Russian cryptocurrency blogger was recently beaten and robbed of $425k](https://cointelegraph.com/news/russia-blogger-who-boasted-about-crypto-wealth-beaten-and-robbed-for-425k). This is why FUNGIBILITY IS ESSENTIAL. [To summarise this in a nutshell:](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6uldp2/monero_privacy_is_not_a_crime_or_something_to/)

>""A lack of fungibility means that when sending or receiving funds, if the other person personally knows you during a transaction, or can get any sort of information on you, or if you provide a residential address for shipping etc. – you could quite potentially have them use this against you for personal gain""

For those that wish to seek more information about why Monero is a superior form of money, read [The Merits of Monero: Why Monero Vs Bitcoin](https://www.monero.how/why-monero-vs-bitcoin) over on the [Monero.how](https://www.monero.how/why-monero-vs-bitcoin) website.



**Monero's Humble Origins** 

Something that still rings true today despite the great influx of money into cryptocurrencies was  outlined in Nick Tomaino's early 2016 [opinion piece]( https://thecontrol.co/meet-the-best-performing-digital-currency-of-2016-monero-e6010768e54a). The author claimed that *""one of the most interesting aspects of Monero is that the project has gained traction without a crowd sale pre-launch, without VC funding and any company or well-known investors and without a pre-mine. Like Bitcoin in the early days, Monero has been a purely grassroots movement that was bootstrapped by the creator and adopted organically without any institutional buy-in. The creator and most of the core developers serve the community pseudonymously and the project was launched on a message board (similar to the way Bitcoin was launched on an email newsletter).""*

**The Organic Growth of the Monero Community** 

The Monero community over at r/monero is exponentially growing. You can view the [Monero reddit metrics here]( http://redditmetrics.com/r/Monero) and see that the Monero subreddit currently gains more than 10,000 (yes, ten thousand!) new subscribers every 10 days! Compare this to most of the other coins out there, and it proves to be one of the only projects with real organic growth. In addition to this, the community subreddits are specifically divided to ensure the main subreddit remains unbiased, tech focused, with no shilling or hype. All trading talk is designated to r/xmrtrader, and all memes at r/moonero. 

**Forum Funding System** 

While most contributors have gratefully volunteered their time to the project, Monero also has a Forum Funding System in which money is donated by community members to ensure it attracts and retains the brightest minds and most skilled developers. Unlike ICOs and other cryptocurrencies, Monero never had a premine, and does not have a developer tax. If ANYONE requires funding for a Monero related project, then they can simply request funding from the community, and if the community sees it as beneficial, they will donate. Types of projects range from Monero funding for local meet ups, to paying developers for their work.

**Monero For Goods, Services, and Market Places** 

[There is a growing number of online goods and services](https://getmonero.org/community/merchants/) that you can now pay for with Monero. 
[Globee](https://globee.com/) is a service that allows online merchants to accept payments through credit cards and a host of cryptocurrencies, while being settled in Bitcoin, Monero or fiat currency. Merchants can reach a wider variety of customers, while not needing to invest in additional hardware to run cryptocurrency wallets or accept the current instability of the cryptocurrency market. Globee uses all of the open source API's that BitPay does making integrations much easier! 

[Project Coral Reef](https://www.projectcoralreef.com) is a service which allows you to shop and pay for popular music band products and services using Monero. 

Linux, Veracrypt, and a whole array of VPNs now accept Monero.

There is a new Monero only marketplace called Annularis [currently being developed]( https://github.com/annularis/shop) which has been created for those who value financial privacy and economic freedom, and there are rumours [Open Bazaar](https://www.openbazaar.org/) is likely to support Monero once Multisig is implemented. 

In addition, Monero is also supported by [The Living Room of Satoshi](https://www.livingroomofsatoshi.com/) so you can pay bills or credit cards directly using Monero. 

Monero can be found on a growing number of cryptocurrency exchange services such as Bittrex, Poloniex, Cryptopia, Shapeshift, Changelly, Bitfinex, Kraken,  Bisq, Tux, [and many others](https://getmonero.org/community/merchants/).

For those wishing to purchase Monero anonymously, there are services such as [LocalMonero.co](https://localmonero.co/) and [Moneroforcash.com](https://moneroforcash.com/).

With [XMR.TO](https://xmr.to/) you can pay Bitcoin addresses directly with Monero. There are no other fees than the miner ones. All user records are purged after 48 hours. XMR.TO has also been added as an embedded feature into the Monerujo android wallet.

**Coinhive Browser-Based Mining** 

Unlike Bitcoin, Monero can be mined using CPUs and GPUs. Not only does this encourage decentralisation, it also opens the door to browser based mining. Enter side of stage, Coinhive browser-based mining. As described by [Hon Lau on the Symnatec Blog](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/browser-mining-cryptocurrency) Browser-based mining, as its name suggests, is a method of cryptocurrency mining that happens inside a browser and is implemented using Javascript. Coinhive is marketed as an alternative to browser ad revenue. The motivation behind this is simple: users pay for the content indirectly by coin mining when they visit the site and website owners don't have to bother users with sites laden with ads, trackers, and all the associated paraphern. This is great, provided that the websites are transparent with site visitors and notify users of the mining that will be taking place, or better still, offer users a way to opt in, although this hasn't always been the case thus far.

**Skepticism Sunday**

The main Monero subreddit has weekly [Skepticism Sundays](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/75w7wt/can_we_make_skepticism_sunday_a_part_of_the/) which was created with the purpose of installing *""a culture of being scientific, skeptical, and rational""*. This is used to have open, critical discussions about monero as a technology, it's economics, and so on.




##**///Speculation///**

**Major Investors And Crypto Figureheads Are Interested** 

Ari Paul is the co-founder and CIO of BlockTower Capital. He was previously a portfolio manager for the University of Chicago's $8 billion endowment, and a derivatives market maker and proprietary trader for Susquehanna International Group. Paul was interviewed on CNBC on the 26th of December and when asked what was his favourite coin was, he stated *""One that has real fundamental value besides from Bitcoin is Monero""* and said it has *""very strong engineering""*. In addition, when he was asked if that was the one used by criminals, he replied *""Everything is used by criminals including the US dollar and the Euro""*. Paul later supported these claims on Twitter, [recommending only Bitcoin and Monero as long-term investments](https://twitter.com/AriDavidPaul/status/950044409332056069).

[There are reports](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/new-digital-currency-spikes-as-drug-dealers-get-more-secrecy-015437551.html) that *""Roger Ver, earlier known as 'Bitcoin Jesus' for his evangelical support of the Bitcoin during its early years, said his investment in Monero is 'substantial' and his biggest in any virtual currency since Bitcoin*.

Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin, has publicly stated his appreciation of Monero. In a September 2017 tweet directed to Edward Snowden explaining why Monero is superior to Zcash, [Charlie Lee tweeted](https://twitter.com/satoshilite/status/913644791144919040):

>All private transactions, More tested privacy tech, No tax on miners to pay investors, No high inflation... better investment.

John McAfee, arguably cryptocurrency's most controversial character at the moment, has publicly supported Monero numerous times over the last twelve months(before he started shilling ICOs), and has even [claimed it will overtake Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c331by6vFz4).

Playboy instagram celebrity Dan Bilzerian is a Monero investor, with [15% of his portfolio made up of Monero](https://www.ccn.com/why-dan-bilzerians-diversified-portfolio-of-cryptocurrencies-is-favorable/).

Finally, while he may not be considered a major investor or figurehead, Erik Finman, a young early Bitcoin investor and multimillionaire, recently appeared in a [CNBC Crypto video interview](https://www.facebook.com/cnbccrypto/videos/vb.1501450679938173/1599864910096749/?type=2&theater), explaining why he isn't entirely sold on Bitcoin anymore, and expresses his interest in Monero, stating:

>""Monero is a really good one. Monero is an incredible currency, it's completely private.""

There is a common belief that most of the money in cryptocurrency is still chasing the quick pump and dumps, however as the market matures, more money will flow into legitimate projects such as Monero. Monero's organic growth in price is evidence *smart money* is aware of Monero and gradually filtering in.

**The Bitcoin Flaw**

A relatively unknown blogger named *CryptoIzzy* posted three poignant pieces regarding Monero and its place in the world. [The Bitcoin Flaw: Monero Rising](https://cryptoizzy.blogspot.com.au/2017/11/the-bitcoin-flaw-monero-rising.html) provides an intellectual comparison of Monero to other cryptocurrencies, and [Valuing Cryptocurrencies: An Approach](https://cryptoizzy.blogspot.com.au/2017/12/valuing-cryptocurrencies-approach.html) outlines methods of valuing different coins. 

CryptoIzzy's most recent blog published only yesterday titled [Monero Valuation - Update and Refocus](https://cryptoizzy.blogspot.com.au/2018/01/monero-valuation-update-and-refocus.html) is a highly recommended read. It touches on why Monero is much more than just a coin for the Darknet Markets, and provides a calculated future price of Monero.

CryptoIzzy also published [The Power of Money: A Case for Bitcoin](https://www.scribd.com/document/360363481/The-Power-of-Money-A-Case-for-Bitcoin), which is an exploration of our monetary system,  and the impact decentralised cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Monero will have on the world. In the epilogue the author also provides a positive and detailed future valuation based on empirical evidence. CryptoIzzy predicts Monero to easily progress well into the *four figure* range.

**Monero Has a Relatively Small Marketcap** 

Recently we have witnessed many newcomers to cryptocurrency neglecting to take into account coins' marketcap and circulating supply, blindly throwing money at coins under $5 with inflated marketcaps and large circulating supplies, and then believing it's possible for them to reach $100 because someone posted about it on Facebook or Reddit.

Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Monero still has a *low marketcap*, which means there is great potential for the price to multiply. At the time of writing, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/), Monero's marketcap is only a little over $5 billion, with a circulating supply of 15.6 million Monero, at a price of $322 per coin. 

For this reason, I would argue that this is evidence Monero is grossly undervalued. *Just* a few billion dollars of new money invested in Monero can cause significant price increases. Monero's marketcap only needs to increase to ~$16 billion and the price will triple to over $1000. If Monero's marketcap simply reached ~$35 billion (just over half of Ripple's $55 billion marketcap), Monero's price will increase 600% to over $2000 per coin. 

Another way of looking at this is Monero's marketcap only requires ~$30 billion of new investor money to see the price per Monero reach $2000, while for Ethereum to reach $2000, Ethereum's marketcap requires a whopping ~$100 billion of new investor money.

**Technical Analysis** 

There are numerous Monero technical analysts, however none more eerily on point than the crowd-pleasing Ero23. Ero23's charts and analysis can be found [on Trading View](https://www.tradingview.com/u/Ero23/). Ero23 gained notoriety for his long-term Bitcoin bull chart published in February, which is still in play today. Head over to his Trading View page to see his chart: [*Monero's dwindling supply. $10k in 2019 scenario*](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XMRUSD/89VEffxW-Monero-s-dwindling-supply-10k-in-2019-scenario/), in which Ero23 predicts Monero to reach $10,000 in 2019. There is also [this chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XMRBTC/JsUOgzrQ-Monero-btc-A-New-Hope-current-price-0-0159btc/) which appears to be freakishly accurate and is tracking along perfectly today.

**Coinbase Rumours** 

Over the past 12 months there have been ongoing rumours that Monero will be one of the next cryptocurrencies to be added to Coinbase. In January 2017, Monero Core team member Riccardo 'Fluffypony' Spagni presented a talk at Coinbase HQ. In addition, in November 2017 GDAX announced the *GDAX Digit Asset Framework* outlining specific parameters cryptocurrencies must meet in order to be added to the exchange. There is speculation that when Monero has numerous mobile and hardware wallets available, and multisig is working, then it will be added. This would enable public accessibility to Monero to increase dramatically as [Coinbase had in excess of 13 million users as of December]( https://futurism.com/coinbase-users-surpasses-charles-schwab-brokerage-accounts/), and is only going to grow as demand for cryptocurrencies increases. Many users argue that due to KYC/AML regulations, Coinbase will never be able to add Monero, however the Kraken exchange already operates in the US and has XMR/fiat pairs, so this is unlikely to be the reason Coinbase is yet to implement XMR/fiat trading. 

**Monero Is Not an ICO Scam** 

It is likely most of the ICOs which newcomers invest in, hoping to get rich quick, won't even be in the Top 100 cryptocurrencies next year. A large portion are most likely to be pumps and dumps, and [we have already seen numerous instances of ICO exit scams](https://cointelegraph.com/news/confido-ico-raises-340k-vanishes). Once an ICO raises millions of dollars, the developers or CEO of the company have little incentive to bother rolling out their product or service when they can just cash out and leave. The majority of people who create a company to provide a service or product, do so in order to generate wealth. Unless these developers and CEOs are committed and believed in their product or service, it's likely that the funds raised during the ICO will far exceed any revenue generated from real world use cases.

**Monero is a Working Currency, Today** 

Monero is a working currency, here today.

The  majority of so called cryptocurrencies that exist today are not true currencies, and do not aim to be. They are a token of exchange. They are like a share in a start-up company hoping to use blockchain technology to succeed in business. A *crypto-assest* is a more accurate name for coins such as Ethereum, Neo, Cardano, Vechain, etc.

Monero isn't just a vaporware ICO token that promises to provide a blockchain service in the future. It is not a platform for apps. It is not a pump and dump coin. 

Monero is the only coin with all the necessary properties to be called true money. 

*Monero is private internet money*. 

Some even describe Monero as an online Swiss Bank Account or Bitcoin 2.0, and it is here to continue on from Bitcoin's legacy. 

Monero is alleviating the public from the grips of banks, and protests the monetary system forced upon us.

Monero only achieved this because it is the heart and soul, and blood, sweat, and tears of the contributors to this project. Monero supporters are passionate, and Monero has gotten to where it is today thanks to its contributors and users. 




##**///Key Issues for Monero to Overcome///**

**Scalability** 

While Bulletproofs are soon to be implemented in order to improve Monero's transaction sizes and fees, scalability is an issue for Monero that is continuously being assessed by Monero's researchers and developers to find the most appropriate solution. [Ricardo 'Fluffypony' Spagni recently appeared on CNBC's Crypto Trader]( https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7pwu4g/no_fluffypony_monero_scales_better_than_bitcoin/), and when asked whether Monero is scalable as it stands today, Spagni stated that presently, Monero's on-chain scaling is horrible and transactions are larger than Bitcoin's (because of Monero's privacy features), so side-chain scaling may be more efficient. Spagni elaborated that the Monero team is, and will always be, looking for solutions to an array of different on-chain and off-chain scaling options, such as developing a Mimblewimble side-chain, exploring the possibility of Lightning Network so atomic swaps can be performed, and Tumblebit.

[In a post on the Monero subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7kdjg2/a_small_note_on_secondlayer_stuff_eg_sidechains/) from roughly a month ago, r/monero moderator u/dEBRUYNE_1 supports Spagni's statements. dEBRUYNE_1 clarifies the issue of scalability:

>""In Bitcoin, the main chain is constrained and fees are ludicrous. This results in users being pushed to second layer stuff (e.g. sidechains, lightning network). Users do not have optionality in Bitcoin. In Monero, the goal is to make the main-chain accessible to everyone by keeping fees reasonable. We want users to have optionality, i.e., let them choose whether they'd like to use the main chain or second layer stuff. We don't want to take that optionality away from them.""

When the Spagni CNBC video was recently [linked to the Monero subreddit]( https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7pwu4g/no_fluffypony_monero_scales_better_than_bitcoin/), it was met with lengthy debate and discussion from both users and developers. u/ferretinjapan summarised the issue explaining: 

>""Monero has all the mechanisms it needs to find the balance between transaction load, and offsetting the costs of miner infrastructure/profits, while making sure the network is useful for users. But like the interviewer said, the question is directed at ""right now"", and Fluffys right to a certain extent, Monero's transactions are huge, and compromises in blockchain security will help facilitate less burdensome transactional activity in the future. But to compare Monero to Bitcoin's transaction sizes is somewhat silly as Bitcoin is nowhere near as useful as monero, and utility will facilitate infrastructure building that may eventually utterly dwarf Bitcoin. And to equate scaling based on a node being run on a desktop being the only option for what classifies as ""scalable"" is also an incredibly narrow interpretation of the network being able to scale, or not. Given the extremely narrow definition of scaling people love to (incorrectly) use, I consider that a pretty crap question to put to Fluffy in the first place, but... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯""

u/xmrusher also contributed to the discussion, comparing Bitcoin to Monero using this analogous description: 

>""While John is much heavier than Henry, he's still able to run faster, because, unlike Henry, he didn't chop off his own legs just so the local wheelchair manufacturer can make money. While Morono has much larger transactions then Bitcoin, it still scales better, because, unlike Bitcoin, it hasn't limited itself to a cripplingly tiny blocksize just to allow Blockstream to make money.""

**Setting up a wallet can still be time consuming** 

It's time consuming and can be somewhat difficult for new cryptocurrency users to set up their own wallet using the GUI wallet or the Command Line Wallet. In order to strengthen and further decentralize the Monero network, users are encouraged to run a full node for their wallet, however this can be an issue because it can take up to 24-48 hours for some users depending on their hard-drive and internet speeds. To mitigate this issue, users can run a remote node, meaning they can remotely connect their wallet to another node in order to perform transactions, and in the meantime continue to sync the daemon so in the future they can then use their own node. 

For users that do run into wallet setup issues, or any other problems for that matter, there is [an extremely helpful troubleshooting thread on the Monero subreddit which can be found here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7hhgjx/monero_gui_01110_helium_hydra_megathread_download/). And not only that, unlike some other cryptocurrency subreddits, if you ask a question, there is always a friendly community member who will happily assist you. [Monero.how]( https://www.monero.how/) is a fantastic resource too!

Despite still being difficult to use, the user-base and price may increase dramatically once it is easier to use. In addition, others believe that when hardware wallets are available more users will shift to Monero. 




##**///Conclusion///**

I actually still feel a little shameful for promoting Monero here, but feel a sense of duty to do so. 

Monero is transitioning into an unstoppable altruistic beast. This year offers the implementation of many great developments, accompanied by the likelihood of a dramatic increase in price.

I request you discuss this post, point out any errors I have made, or any information I may have neglected to include. Also, if you believe in the Monero project, I encourage you to join your local Facebook or Reddit cryptocurrency group and spread the word of Monero. You could even link this post there to bring awareness to new cryptocurrency users and investors.

I will leave you with an old on-going joke within the Monero community - *Don't buy Monero* - unless you have a use case for it of course :-)  Just think to yourself though - Do I have a use case for Monero in our unpredictable Huxleyan society? Hint: The answer is ?

"The Apollo Currency Team (APL) just engaged in a massive pump and dump scheme, dumping hundreds of millions of coins on their investors",1486,aimysg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/aimysg/the_apollo_currency_team_apl_just_engaged_in_a/,217,1548193531.0,"Coinmarketcap several minutes after the dump (peaked around -78%): [https://imgur.com/a/MbnSLZV](https://imgur.com/a/MbnSLZV)

I tried to warn everyone two days ago. But now here we are, it's too late, the team has cashed out.

Most of you saw my recent post here about all the red flags of the recent Apollo cryptocurrency - the way they censored their social channels/Telegram, how they encouraged their members to stock up and and BUY and banned anyone who talked about selling instantly. How they actively pumped up the price of their coin the past couple of weeks through fake news and shill armies.

That's not why we're here.

I was just online when I notice a sell order on the APL exchange. Wait not just one sell order. Many. And then I went to the other APL exchanges. Same situation. Suddenly hundreds of millions of APL were hitting all exchanges all at once in a massive dump that sent the price shooting down over 70%.

I immediately went to the block explorer. The Apollo block explorer features no rich lists for obvious reasons, so I knew I had limited time to find the dev’s accounts and their transactions that would cause the dump in the history. Low and behold, I found a couple of them: [https://imgur.com/a/vXi2GXE](https://imgur.com/a/vXi2GXE)

[https://explorer.apollowallet.org/accounts/8638689226260340876](https://explorer.apollowallet.org/accounts/8638689226260340876)

[https://explorer.apollowallet.org/accounts/4357878630730037753](https://explorer.apollowallet.org/accounts/4357878630730037753)

[https://explorer.apollowallet.org/accounts/8981386827427737067](https://explorer.apollowallet.org/accounts/8981386827427737067)

[https://explorer.apollowallet.org/accounts/285778997163958679](https://explorer.apollowallet.org/accounts/285778997163958679)

I didn't continue to go back in time on the block explorer, but you all know where to go look if you want to find the team's accounts now for this ""anonymous"" currency. I checked the balances on several of those accounts and some had around a billion APL, with the others having hundreds of million. The only people who own anywhere near this much are the Apollo team (and possibly John McAfee, lol).

I will continue to edit this and add information but want to get it out there now while this is happening so people can start discussing it in here.

Previous post from 2 days ago if you want to catch up on what's been going on up until this point: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ai5b62/apollo\_apl\_is\_a\_massive\_scam\_and\_you\_are\_all/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ai5b62/apollo_apl_is_a_massive_scam_and_you_are_all/)

*(My last post was removed by the automod for having the word ""Mega-thread"" in the title. I'll repost everything here so people are aware of what's happening and continue to provide updates.*

# Updates

**7:10 AM update**: APL Telegram Channel put on read-only mode for 10 minutes

**7:25 AM update**: Re-enabled, the admins are now threatening to mute anyone who mentions anything about the dump and encouraging people to ""buy cheap"": [https://imgur.com/a/xyptHBp](https://imgur.com/a/xyptHBp)

**8:05 AM update**: They are BANNING everyone from the telegram who tries to talk about the situation in a negative light, asks a question about what happened, or tries to ask any of these questions over PM to another member: [https://imgur.com/a/kWx3ULe](https://imgur.com/a/kWx3ULe)

**8:07 PM update:** Bitmart's entire exchange has went completely offline as well (the main exchange for trading APL). APL is now only actively trading on Coinbene. To Check Statuses: [Link to Bitmart](https://www.bitmart.com/trade?symbol=APL_BTC). [Link to Coinbene.](https://www.coinbene.com/exchange.html#/exchange?pairId=APLETH)

**9:10 AM update:** APL Telegram is saying everyone is buying APL on Coinbene (only active APL exchange left right now) to get back in. However, every one of these ""buy"" trades is actually just a wash trade and never actually appears on the exchange - it's conducted between the highest bid and lowest ask. You can watch the order book for 30 seconds and look at the prices of the last ""buy orders"" to confirm that this is wash trading.

**9:14 AM update:** The APL founder Steve McCullah is finally in the Telegram, he has not acknowledged the situation yet and has said ""everything is great"": [https://imgur.com/a/idnE6wH](https://imgur.com/a/idnE6wH)

**9:18 AM update:** Steve confirms everything will be fine and includes rocket ship emoji's in his post to ensure his loyal telegram followers that this coin is still going to the moon: [https://imgur.com/a/BkjA0MA](https://imgur.com/a/BkjA0MA)

**9:35 AM update:** I'm seriously having issues not typing anything in the Telegram so I can continue to provide updates. It's getting tough watching Steve continue to ignore the situation, using rocket ship emoji's, and acting like everything is just perfect after (allegedly) dumping a ton of coins earlier this morning on investors. All opposition or people speaking out in the group have already been banned and messaging has slowed down a lot. Steve is telling people not to worry about anything as there will be a big announcement today or tomorrow: [https://imgur.com/a/NKFTkM3](https://imgur.com/a/NKFTkM3)

**9:53 PM update:** Steve is has just continuing on with the ""everything is fine"" narrative and not acknowledging anything.

**9:55 PM update:** I just want to make people aware that this could be happening but by no means definitely is (this is theory, not fact, but should be considered given the situation):

MASSIVE buying up of all the sell orders just appeared in the order books on Bitmart, the main exchange for APL and the place where Steve or the team deposited the majority of their APL: [https://imgur.com/a/LrhNnQn](https://imgur.com/a/LrhNnQn)

Steve starts talking about the APL price and how it's going back up again RIGHT as these buys happened: [https://imgur.com/a/gobtQUf](https://imgur.com/a/gobtQUf)

It seems very obvious to anyone watching the Telegram that he is trying to cover his tracks by buying up back to a reasonable price so the price of APL dropping 78% in 1 minute earlier doesn't seem apparent. Like I said, it's what it looked like but there's no way to confirm that's actually what just happened.",2019-01-23 05:45:31

Many people here have invested in Cardano because of the scientific mentality it claims to be based upon.

Why REQ will completely overtake PayPal,1450,7oe61g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7oe61g/why_req_will_completely_overtake_paypal/,267,1515213999.0,"Applying the blockchain to, for example, a payment service essentially **automates the role of the middleman**. If person A wants to securely send money to person B, he can rely on PayPal, that will carry out all the labor that's required to administrate and secure that payment, while in turn taking a fee.

That **fee needs to cover PayPal's payroll, employee benefits, inventory, materials, supplies, overhead, operating expenses, taxes, and insurance, after which it can finally yield a profit**. Fortunately for PayPal, its competitors all need to account for those same costs, so any competitive advantage only comes from the margins and/or scale.

But that same payment service, founded on a decentralized network like REQ, is free from those tremendous costs. The blockchain, not salaried employees, administrates and validates. **This is true efficiency**, and it is a COLOSSAL competitive advantage. That can't be overstated.

With that said, how does PayPal compete alongside REQ (this is a simplified example)? I can't imagine a back-and-forth in market share between REQ and any payment service that's also not based on the blockchain. **REQ's competitive advantage would be too great**, so PayPal and the rest would either have to adapt or fold.

I ask because there was a projection analysis on REQ posted the other day, which figured a 3% market share a number of years down the road. But if we truly understand why any blockchain-based application/service is not merely another competitor in the market, but rather **a total overhaul/upgrade of outdated business models brought forth by unprecedented network-driven efficiencies**, then how can we be so conservative?",2018-01-06 12:46:39

My theory on the real cause of today's chaos (expiring futures contracts allowing for risk-free market manipulation),1444,7qw4ej,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7qw4ej/my_theory_on_the_real_cause_of_todays_chaos/,511,1516170027.0,"**TL;DR - The cause of today's chaos is likely large hedge funds using expiring BTC futures contracts as safety nets to exploit the only sure-thing in this market: a large amount of new/overextended investors who are easily moved to panic sell during a flash-crash.**
  

On December 10, BTC futures trading went live.  The first set of those contracts is set to expire tomorrow, January 17.
  

For those who don't know, futures contracts are agreements to buy/sell an asset (like BTC) at a specified future date and price.  As the price of BTC was ~$15,000 on Dec. 10 , the first BTC futures contracts, which expire tomorrow, were fixed at about that same price.  In a simplified form, this means that tomorrow:

* the ""short"" side of those contracts must give the ""long"" side a BTC (which could simply be bought at tomorrow's market price) [Edit: as others have pointed out, these contracts are cash settled, so the ""short"" side doesn't actually swap a BTC - it just pays the BTC market price at expiration. However, the net result is the same either way] ; and  
* the ""long"" side of those contracts must pay the ""short"" side $15,000 in return.
  

Now imagine you are a large hedge fund evaluating these contracts, and the crypto market as a whole, on Dec. 10.  Obviously, making a large bet on either the ""long"" or ""short"" side is extremely risky, since the price of BTC when the contracts expire (January 17) could very easily be $50,000 or $500.  This makes large bets on either side a bad option for a large institutional investor like yourself.  
  

However, you also know that crypto is still an emerging market with a large amount of new investors and ""dumb money.""  And because you are a large hedge fund, futures contracts opens the door to a third option: make large bets on BOTH sides to gain risk-free market leverage, use that leverage to manufacture market chaos, and profit on the near-guaranteed ripple effects of that chaos with virtually no risk.  Here is how:

* Bet big on the ""short"" side of the futures contracts on Dec. 10.  Let's say you do this for 10,000 BTCs.  This means that on January 17 you will owe 10,000 BTCs (Edit: cash equivalent) to the ""long"" side of those contracts, receiving $15k per BTC ($150,000,000) in return.

* Buy an equally large amount of BTC on Dec. 10 at the market price ($15k/BTC).  This cancels out your risk/reward for the futures contracts entirely, making you immune to all changes in BTC's price while you hold both the contracts and BTCs.  This also allows you to accumulate and hold an extremely large portion of the BTC market while taking essentially no risk.

* Shortly before your futures contracts expire, dump all of your 10,000 BTC on the market at once.  Like clockwork, this will trigger stop-losses and panic sells from the consumer BTC market, virtually guaranteeing that the BTC price will continue to dip well below whatever price you just sold those 10,000 BTC for.   

* Ride that dip you just created to buy back the 10,000 BTC for much less than the price you just sold them for.  This is particularly easy, since the funds you need are already liquid and ready to get back in the market.  

* Use the re-purchased 10,000 BTC for the expiring futures contracts, which get swapped for your initial investment ($15k/BTC).  The difference in the price that you sold the 10,000 BTCs to start the dip from the price that you bought the BTCs back during the dip becomes your net profit.  

[Edit: Because the BTC futures are settled in cash, the last two steps above can be skipped with the same net result.  However, the BTC can/should still be repurchased during the manufactured dip so it can be used for the next round of expiring BTC futures.]

For funds with access to enough capital to move the crypto market, this play should be easy money.  It would also explain the series of huge dips (seemingly out of nowhere) that we are dealing with today.
  

If I'm right about the cause (and I'm fairly confident that I am), the good news is that today's dips are likely temporary and not signs of a more serious issue with cryptocurrencies as a whole.  The bad news is that I don't know how this can be stopped as long as the prospect of capitalizing off of market fear remains a huge carrot for the sharks in this market.

Understanding Bitcoin Futures: How they work and why they are NOT going to crash the crypto market,1439,7tdc3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7tdc3w/understanding_bitcoin_futures_how_they_work_and/,122,1517096111.0,"Recently there has been a lot of talk about Bitcoin futures causing downward pressure for prices, especially with expectations of a crash around expiry date. Its clear that not many understand how derivatives work or why the specific structure of the CME/CBOE future contracts makes it so there is a pretty much no chance that there is a collusive scheme by futures traders to crash Bitcoin.

So I wrote up a quick description of how it works, and why there are 3 major reasons that futures are not to blame for Bitcoin's decline in price.

#How futures contracts work
-------------------------------

Futures contracts are an agreement to buy or sell an asset on a specific date in the future at a specified price. If you take a long position, you agree to buy an asset in the future at a specific price when the contract expires. When you take a short position, you agree to sell an asset at a set price when the contract expires.

A simple example to illustrate: Think of a shipping company who has a bunch deliveries planned in a year. The price of fuel is $2 per gallon today. They can enter a futures contract on an exchange that will allow them to buy say 10,000 gallons of fuel at $2.5 per gallon. A fuel wholesaler might be willing to take this contract on to lock in the $2.5 price guarantee. If a year from now the price of fuel rises to $4 dollars a gallon, the shipping company will save (4-2.5) x 1000 = $15,000. In this case its a risk management tool, often used in financial markets to hedge against the risk of changing prices. However it can also be used by speculators, simply to profit off expected changes in price and these are generally cash settled.

Bitcoin futures are cash settled, meaning **no bitcoins actually change hands when a contract expires**. The differential between spot prices (ie. current price) and the contract price is settled with cash. Winning traders effectively collect their gains from the losers.

A key point to realize is that **futures markets are a zero-sum game**. For every long there is a short. For every winner, there’s a loser. Every dollar of one trader’s profit is a dollar lost by another trader. If someone wants to bet big that bitcoin is going down, say, by shorting 1,000 bitcoin contracts, there needs to be one or more traders willing to take the opposite side.

Bitcoin futures trade on two exchanges: CME and CBOE.

The CME is the big one and offers contracts with a unit size of 5 BTC per contract. It has a contract limit of 1,000, meaning that no one party can have more than 1,000 contracts.

The CBOE offers contracts with a unit size of 1 BTC per contract. It has a contract limit of 5,000 contracts.


#Why Bitcoin Futures aren't crashing Bitcoin
------------------

**Reason #1: There simply isn't enough open interest position or volume**

You can look at the total open interest and volume for BTC Futures on the CME for January 25th, a day before expiry:

http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_volume_voi.html?marginsTab=SOM

The total volume for January was 769, the total volume for all months up to June 2018 is 1,223 contracts. The ""open interest"" number is the number of contracts which are still open (ie. haven't settled) and its only 139. If you go back to the beginning of the period just after the prior expire date, there were only 560 open contracts for the January 26th expiration date.

What this means that the total market on CME for shorting futures for the end of January period was only 560 x 5 =  2,800 BTC. 

What if those evil Wall Street suits had the brilliant idea to buy Bitcoin back when it was $8,000 and then now flash sell it to bring the price down to profit off the short side? On January 19 the open interest was 560 contracts and the BTC price was $11,500, lets say the entire open interest is actually one group of people colluding to profit off the short positions. That means there is a total of 2,800 BTC value is contractually at stake, with a total nominal value of $32.2 million. Futures markets have something called ""margin requirements"", which is the minimum amount you have to pony up as collateral when taking a futures position. For Bitcoin its 43%, which means that they would need to put in $13.8 million of capital to short 2,800 Bitcoin.

According to [Bitcointy](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/30d?c=e&t=b), the volume traded in Bitcoin/USD on January 19 was around 134,000, with about 16 million BTC in circulation. This actually drastically underestimates the total volume of BTC traded since it excludes the big Asian markets, but let actually give the scenario this benefit. Lets imagine that someone would need to purchase just half of the daily volume (about 77K BTC) or about 0.5% of the total Bitcoin supply and then dumped it, and lets say this caused a huge $3K drop in Bitcoin price from its $11,500 price level back to about $8,500. They would need to pony up $616 milion to purchase just 77K BTC (0.5% of the supply) at $8,000. Assuming they achieve the $3K drop in price, that would net them a profit of 2800 BTC x $3,000 = $8.4 million from a $11,500 settlement price, or about 1% profit on their BTC purchase investment, less than a guaranteed government bond. All of this is assuming that 0.5% of the outstanding float would be enough to drive the price down $3K, and that they could somehow not experience substantial loses themselves in the dump. Basically it doesn't make any sense, the volume of open interest for futures available is simply too low to make this anything akin to profitable. Even if we assume there was a collusion scheme by everyone participating in the short market.

You can look at the Settlements to see the total open interest for all remaining months:

http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_settlements_futures.html?marginsTab=SOM

The total open interest for all months up to June on January 25th is only 1,459 contracts. That's means the entire market for shorting Bitcoin up to June is only 7,295 BTC. No matter where you set the entry point, the return simply doesn't justify the risk or initial investment required.

**Reason #2: The margin requirements are too high to offer enough leverage to manipulate the market**

One attraction of trading futures is the ability to use relatively small amounts of money to potentially achieve outsized returns. In a lot of futures market, the margin (the amount of money that your broker requires up-front) can be quite small compared to the ultimate value of the contract. For example looking at [CME Futures market for S&P 500 futures](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/e-mini-sandp500.html), each contract is worth about $143,000 (50 x S&P 500 value) and the margin requirement is only $4,800 (as of writing this) or about 3.3% nominal margin rate. 

Your margin account balance is adjusted at the end of every trading day to account for the winnings or losses of the day, this is called daily settlement. If your account balance falls below the margin minimum of $4.8K you'll need to quickly add money to your account or your position will be summarily closed out by your broker. On the plus side, if you've predicted the S&P's direction correctly your profits will be that same as if you completely owned the underlying stocks in the index. A +1% daily move in the S&P500 would yield $1430 (1% of $143,000) in profit even though you only have $4800 invested - a huge return on. Margin requirements this low are only possible because the volatility of the S&P 500 is pretty low and well understood.

On the other hand Bitcoin futures have massive maintenance margin rates. The CBOE requires 40% of the notional amount for maintenance margin, the CME requires 43%. Your broker will likely require more than that. 

Because of the high margin requirements, Bitcoin futures don't offer much leverage compared to just buying Bitcoins outright. You would need to place a huge amount of capital at risk just to get one Bitcoin contract on CME, the equivalent of 5 x (BTC USD value) x 0.43. If you wanted to short just 5 BTC and the price was 11K, that would require a margin of $23,650 to be maintained.

**Reason #3: The big Wall Street Levered Funds aren't actually that into shorting Bitcoin**

The CBOE is smaller than CME, but one neat thing about it is that it releases statistics on groupings for its futures markets, it gives out information on long vs short positions among Levered Funds, Other Reportable entities and Non-reportable. 

The Levered Funds is what we would call ""Wall Street"", large hedge funds that invest other people's money. The  ""Other Reportable"" would be other institutional investors but not necessarily trading with other's people's money, and the ""Non Reportable"" are small time investors and speculators. Here is the breakdown of Bitcoin Futures open interest contracts by these categories:

**Levered Funds** (Large Wall Street hedge funds)

Long | Short
---|-----
1142 | 518
 
**Other Reportable** (Other trading firms that don't necessarily manage money for outside investors)

Long |Short
---|-----
1243 | 3668

**Non Reportable** (ie. small speculators)

Long | Short
---|-----
2665 | 919

http://www.cftc.gov/dea/futures/financial_lf.htm


As you can see 68% of the Levered Funds actually go long on Bitcoin! 

For ""Other Reportable"" you do have more short interest, but it only adds up to 3668 contracts and at 1 BTC/contract its only 3668 BTC, against 1243 BTC that are long. Finally the non-Reportable are the small time speculators and they're overwhelmingly long. There are a few other smaller categories that make up the difference, but overall there isn't any wide spread of short vs. longs between the big levered funds and the more retail investors.

#So what did cause Bitcoin's correction around the first expiry date?
--------------------------------

There was a plethora of factors that compounded around that mid-January expiry date: the cyclical selloff period that we usually see combined with FUD headlines coming out quickly regarding regulation out of China, Korea and Europe. Its highly unlikely that futures actually caused any of the sell off, they actually provide stability by helping with price discovery.

If futures do have any downward price pressure on Bitcoin, its largely psychological. Let face it, most Bitcoin investors don't understand anything about finance or derivatives, to them the CME futures are this big scary Wall Street boogeyman that is trying to take Bitcoin down. In essence you got a self fulfilling prophecy, lots of people feared the futures expiration would cause a crash so they panicked and sold, bringing the price down. Its a perfect thing to scapegoat after the huge bubble we saw started to correct. This is what I fear, that a lot of people will now look to anything to point their finger at to blame for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency price declines. Everything will be scapegoated, from the CME futures to ""weak hand Asians"" to governments to Wall Street. 

As we inevitably revert to the mean, very few will be willing to accept that it was their own unrealistic expectations of returns that are continually parabolic that is the sole reason for the gross mispricing of most cryptocurrencies.

BTC has crashed many times. So has the stock market. Neither of them are going anywhere.

> In order to address this, we must first look at the Ethereum blockchain. This image (http://prntscr.com/hyrjmm) shows the growth of Ethereum transactions since the release of Ethereum. You can see that recently there has been an exponential increase in the volume of transactions occurring on the Ethereum Blockchain. What this means is that transaction fees are very competitive right now. If you want your transaction to be prioritised, you are required to pay higher miner fees. Our dynamic system is configured to set the fees to the equivalent of 0.01 ETH/ withdrawal. This amount does not change based on the quantity you withdraw in one withdrawal because on blockchain, a $50 transfer paying a $5 fee is treated the exact same as a $500,000 transfer paying a $5 fee.

https://np.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/7qxig5/binance_updates_and_suggestions/

However, when we check the fees at https://ethgasstation.info/index.php, the fees are not as near as high as Binance claims. So Binance is effectively gouging its customers.

*Disclaimer: I am not and have never been affiliated with any of the mentioned parties in a private or professional matter.*

Presumably in an attempt to smear a local competitor, Hayden Otto inadvertently publishes irrefutable on-chain proof that he excluded non-BCH retail revenue to shape the ""BCH #1 in Australia"" narrative.


- Scroll down to **""Proof of exclusion""** if you are tired of the drama recap.
- Scroll down to **""TLDR""** if you want a summary.

****

## Recap
In September 2019, BitcoinBCH.com started publishing so called monthly ""reports"" about crypto retail payments in Australia. They claimed that **~90% of Australia's crypto retail revenue is processed via their own HULA system** and that **~92% of all crypto retail revenue happens in BCH**.

They are aggregating two data sources to come up with this claim.

One is **TravelByBit (TBB)** who *publishes* their PoS transactions (BTC, LN, ETH, BNB, DASH, BCH) live on a [ticker](https://travelbybit.com/stats).

The other source is **HULA**, a newly introduced POS system (BCH only) and direct competitor to TBB run by BitcoinBCH.com - the same company who created the report. Despite being on-chain their transactions are *private*, not published and not verifiable by third parties outside BitcoinBCH.com

Two things stood out in the ""reports"", noted by multiple users (including vocal BCH proponents):

- **The non-BCH parts must have tx excluded and the report neglects to mention it** (the total in their TBB analysis does not match what is reported on the TBB website.)
- **The BCH part has outliers included** (e.g. BCH city conference in September with 35x the daily average)

The TBB website loads the historic tx data in the browser but hides transactions older than 7 days from being displayed, i.e. you can access more than 7 days worth of data if you understand JavaScript and can read the source code ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dklkwc/92_of_australias_crypto_retail_volume_is_in_bch/f4mnfas/)).


## Hayden Otto's reaction

In direct response to me publishing these findings on r/btc, Hayden Otto - an employee at BitcoinBCH.com and the author of the report who also happens to be a moderator of /r/BitcoinCash - banned me immediately from said sub ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dincg5/ucryptostrategies_banned_me_from_rbitcoincash_for/)).

In subsequent discussion (which repeated for every monthly ""report"" which was flawed in the same ways as described above), Hayden responded using the same tactics:

***

**""No data was removed""**

> ""The guy is straight out lying. There is guaranteed no missing tx as the data was collected directly from the source."" ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ds0967/october_report_for_australian_crypto_expenditure/f6nldiy/))

****

**""Only data I considered non-retail was removed""**

> ""I also had these data points and went through them to remove non-retail transactions, on both TravelbyBit and HULA."" ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dibzek/crypto_payments_not_adding_up_for_australia_and/f3vu2dh/))

He admits to have removed non-BCH tx by ""Game Ranger"" because he considers them non-retail ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8z3ox/)). He also implies they might be involved in money laundering and that TBB might fail their AML obligations in processing Game Ranger's transactions ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8vclc/)).

The report does not mention any data being excluded at all and he still fails to explain why several businesses that are clearly retail (e.g. restaurants, cafes, markets) had tx excluded ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dqfcmz/bitcoin_cash_bch_outspent_bitcoin_core_btc_by_a/f65izlk/)).

****

**""You are too late to prove I altered the data""**

> ""[...] I recorded [the data] manually from https://travelbybit.com/stats/ over the month of September. The website only shows transactions from the last 7 days **and then they disappear. No way for anyone to access stats beyond that.**"" ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dicdh3/bitcoinbchcoms_bch_is_1_in_australia_report_is/f3wip9j/))

Fortunately you can, if you can read the website's source code. But you need to know a bit of JavaScript to verify it yourself, so not an ideal method to easily prove the claim of data exclusion to the public. But it laters turns out Hayden himself has found an easier way to achieve the same.

***

**""The report can't be wrong because it has been audited.""**

In response to criticism about the flawed methodology in generating the September report, BitcoinBCH.com hired an accountant from a regional Bitcoin BCH startup to ""audit"" the October report. This is remarkable, because not only did their reported TBB totals still not match those from the TBB site - their result was mathematically impossible. How so? No subset of TBB transaction in that month sums up to the total they reported. So even if they excluded retail transactions at will, they still must have messed up the sum ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ds11om/the_markets_have_yet_to_pricein_bitcoin_cashs/f6mui0q/)). Why didn't their auditor notice their mistake? She said she ""conducted a review based on the TravelByBit data **provided to her**"", i.e. the data acquisition and selection process was **explicitly excluded from the audit** ([source](https://bitcoinbch.com/assets/img/blog/october-report/october2019audit.pdf)).

***
**""You are a 'pathetic liar', a 'desperate toll', an 'astroturf account' and 'a total dumb ass' and are 'pulling numbers out of your ass!'""**


Since he has already banned me from the sub he moderates, he started to resort to ad hominems ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dqfcmz/bitcoin_cash_bch_outspent_bitcoin_core_btc_by_a/f68ppam/), [source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8pbgh/), [source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8vclc/), [source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8zaca/)).

## Proof of exclusion

I published raw data as extracted from the TBB site after each report for comparison. Hayden responded that I made those numbers up and that I [was pulling numbers out of my ass](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8zaca/).

Since he was under the impression that

> ""The website only shows transactions from the last 7 days **and then they disappear. No way for anyone to access stats beyond that.**"" ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dicdh3/bitcoinbchcoms_bch_is_1_in_australia_report_is/f3wip9j/))

he felt confident to claim that I would be

> unable to provide a source for the [missing] data and/or **prove that that data was not already included in the report**. ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dklkwc/92_of_australias_crypto_retail_volume_is_in_bch/f4j4o6z/))

Luckily for us Hayden Otto seems to dislike his competitor TravelByBit so much that he attempted to reframe Bitcoin's RBF feature as a vulnerability specific to TBB PoS system ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ecdze0/at_this_very_moment_you_can_go_and_double_spend/)).

While doublespending a merchant using the TBB PoS he wanted to prove that the merchant successfully registered the purchase as complete and thus exposed that **the PoS sales history of TBB's merchants are available to the public** ([source](https://youtu.be/lLkiu8zs318?t=329)), in his own words:

> ""You can literally access it from a public URL in the Web browser. There is no login or anything required, just type in the name of the merchant."" ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eeqx9n/australia_travelbybit_crypto_pos_provider_is/fbwd0tn/))

As of yet it is unclear if this is intentional by TBB or if Hayden Ottos followed the rules of responsible disclosure before publishing this kind of data leak.

As it happens, those sale histories do not only include the merchant and time of purchases, they **even include the address the funds were sent to (in case of on-chain payments)**.

This gives us an easy method to prove that the purchases from the TBB website missing in the reports belong to a specific retail business and actually happened - something that is impossible to prove for the alleged HULA txs.

In order to make it easier for you to verify it yourself, we'll focus on a single day in the dataset, **September 17th, 2019** as an example:

- Hayden Otto's report claims **20 tx and $713.00** in total for that day ([source](https://bitcoinbch.com/blog/Australian-Cryptocurrency-Expenditure-at-Retail-Businesses.html))
- The TBB website listed **40 tx and a total of $1032.90** ([daily summary](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dibzek/crypto_payments_not_adding_up_for_australia_and/f3x07i2/))
- Pick a merchant, e.g. ""The Stand Desserts""
- Use Hayden's ""trick"" to access that merchants public sale history at https://www.livingroomofsatoshi.com/merchanthistory/thestanddesserts, sort by date to find the 17th Sep 2019 and look for a transaction at 20:58 for $28. This proves that a purchase of said amount is associated with this specific retail business.
- Paste the associated crypto on-chain address  `17MrHiRcKzCyuKPtvtn7iZhAZxydX8raU9` in a blockchain explorer of your choice, e.g like [this](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/17MrHiRcKzCyuKPtvtn7iZhAZxydX8raU9). This proves that a transfer of funds has actually happened.

I let software aggregate the TBB statistics with the public sale histories and you'll find at the bottom of this post a table with the on-chain addresses conveniently linked to blockchain explorers for our example date.

The total of **all 40 tx is $1032.90** instead of the $713.00 reported by Hayden. 17 tx of those have a corresponding on-chain address and thus have undeniable proof of $758.10. Of the remaining 23, 22 are on Lightning and one had no merchant history available.

This is just for a single day, here is a comparison for the whole month.

| Description | Total |
| - | - |
| TBB Total | $10,502|
| TBB wo. Game Ranger|$5,407|
| TBB according to Hayden|$3,737|

## What now?

The usual shills will respond in a predictive manner: The data must be fake even though its proof is on-chain, I would need to provide more data but HULA can be trusted without any proof, if you include outliers BCH comes out ahead, yada, yada.

But this is not important. I am not here to convince them and this post doesn't aim to.

The tx numbers we are talking about are less than 0.005% of Bitcoin's global volume. If you can increase adoption in your area by 100% by just buying 2 coffees more per day you get a rough idea about how irrelevant the numbers are in comparison.

What is relevant though and what this post aims to highlight is that BitcoinBCH.com and the media outlets around news.bitcoin.com flooding you with the BCH #1 narrative are playing dirty. They feel justified because they feel that Bitcoin/Core/Blockstream is playing dirty as well. I am not here to judge that but you as a reader of this sub should be aware that this is happening and that you are the target.

When BitcoinBCH.com excludes $1,000 Bitcoin tx because of high value but includes $15,000 BCH tx because they are made by ""professionals"", you should be sceptical.

When BitcoinBCH.com excludes game developers, travel businesses or craftsmen accepting Bitcoin because they don't have a physical store but include a lawyer practice accepting BCH, you should be sceptical.

When BitcoinBCH.com excludes restaurants, bars and supermarkets accepting Bitcoin and when pressed reiterate that they excluded **non-retail** businesses without ever explaning why a restaurant shouldn't be considered reatil, you should be sceptical.

When BitcoinBCH.com claims the reports have been audited but omit that the data acquisition was not part of the audit, you should be sceptical.

I expect that BitcoinBCH.com will stop removing transactions from TBB for their reports now that it has been shown that their exclusion can be provably uncovered. I also expect that HULA's BCH numbers will rise accordingly to maintain a similar difference.

Hayden Otto assumed that nobody could cross-check the TBB data. He was wrong. Nobody will be able to disprove his claims when HULA's BCH numbers rise as he continues to refuse their release. You should treat his claims accordingly.

As usual, do your own research and draw your own conclusion. Sorry for the long read.

## TLDR

- BitcoinBCH.com claimed no transactions were removed from the TBB dataset in their BCH #1 reports and that is impossible to prove the opposite.
- Hayden Otto's reveals in a double spend attempt that a TBB merchant's sale history can be accessed publicly including the merchant's on-chain addresses.
- This table shows 40 tx listed on the TBB site on sep 17th, including their on-chain addresses where applicable.
- The BitcoinBCH.com report lists only 20 tx for the same day.

Why I HODL? My Past. And My Story from the Future. Why I will not make the same mistake twice.,1380,7u5pj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7u5pj6/why_i_hodl_my_past_and_my_story_from_the_future/,385,1517386916.0,"I am in my mid-forties and lived through the dot-com bubble. I built websites for some great and not-so great companies.  I owned some shares of companies that we all know very well today.  When the dot-com bubble burst I was in my mid-twenties.  I listened to everyone around me as they told me the Internet was a bubble.  I gave up my Internet dreams and hopes of fortune, sold the stocks, and invested in myself… I went back to school.  If I had kept working in the Internet business, if I have kept those stocks….

Many years later I am in the same spot again.  And this time, I will not make the same mistake again. I will not sell the cryptos I really believe in today because I know they will be worth so much more in the future. Tonight, I plan to tell this story in the not so distant future.

I bought my cryptos and rode them through the highs and lows.  During January of 2018 the entire world was shouting at me that I was a fool in a bubble.  Family, friends, media - it is just a bubble is all I heard.  Then the regulation rumors, and worse the Tether rumors.  I held through all of them.  And then on January 30, with the US stock market selling off, the crypto markets started selling off again.  And selling hard.   

I held. When everyone said sell, I held.  And now many years in the future I can say, I bought Ripple for under twenty cents each.  And with 500% gains, in the face of the world telling me it was a bubble.  I held.  And now many years later, I am…. Wealthy.  Very very wealthy.

And it’s not just Ripple, it’s Stellar, Cardano, Litecoin. (Insert your favorites here.) I held.  And I was patient. Unlike what I did in the dot-com burst, I did not let fear and the world dictate what I knew then was true.  I knew the Internet would change the world, but I was not patient.  I will give these block-chain technologies the time they need to mature.  I will give the industry the time it needs to grow.  And in the end, I will be successful.

I am not a trader.  I cannot catch these falling knives each week.  I am in this for the long haul.

My prediction is this.  The U.S. stock market, bond market, cryptos and even gold and silver sold off today.  There was no place to hide.  Investors are holding ridiculous amounts of cash - cash that is also losing value.  The stock market will take off tomorrow after Trump’s speech, which I am betting will be very pro business and will rally traders tomorrow.  After the stock market hits new highs, the investors will want new places to invest… cryptos will be waiting.  As the Lunar New Year ends, and investors seek better returns cryptos will come back.  

Tonight is not the night to sell.  Tonight is the night to plan your story.

**Summary:**

I've been following QSP for some time now, and I'm preparing to make a call on going in or not.

Essentially, Quantstamp is a means of auditing Ethereum based smart contracts.

The part I find most interesting is this:

""The Quantstamp protocol is a scalable system to audit all projects on Ethereum.""

That is, QSP, in theory, has applicable uses across all(?) Ethereum based coins.

**Which is huge.**

This meme sums it up pretty nicely: https://i.redd.it/490rfvh0g2201.png

I'd love to hear the thoughts of the wider Cryptocurrency community, so please fire away - whether you think it's going to tank due to technical issues or head to the moon, throw your 2cents into the bucket.

To all the weak hands.... you got played by wall street whales.,1367,7vyhnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7vyhnd/to_all_the_weak_hands_you_got_played_by_wall/,549,1518059074.0,"Think I'm kidding? You really think a machine as lucrative as wall street which has turned generating dollars into a science would ever remain on the sidelines?

How exactly did you think the ""institutional money"" that we've all delcared was waiting, would enter the game? At the ATH's WEEEEEE created?

Media assaulted your profits. Article after article touting the end of the world. Blockchain techies kept saying, ""HODL."" 

You didn't listen. 

'India is banning cryptocurrencies.' was the written rumor, and it spread like wildfire around the globe. 

The truth - that the finance minister's words were exaggerated, didn't even reach your twitter feed. Did you ask yourself ""why?""

Then came this diddy: 'China is banning cryptocurrencies.'   

Are they?  Tell you what, when NEO announces it's closing its doors forever, I'll believe China is banning crypto. Did NEO close its doors?

A tsunami of FUD flooded our social media at the same exact time Bitcoin drops like a hot potato, just like it has done every year at the same exact time. This campaign really wasn't difficult for Wall Street Whales to plan. 

A symphony of FUD composed for your very eyes, timed perfectly to lead up to the SEC's meeting yesterday. 

And what came out of the meeting?  Why gee, look at that, the US isn't banning crypto. But it will be regulated (which is wonderful). 

But wait... then.. right after the meeting ends Mark Warner, the US senator from VA, gets his lackeys in the media to print an article where he states there's no way to ban crypto because the underlining blockchain technology is too revolutionary. 

He stated that he sees blockchain more transformational than cellphones. In fact, he even threw out numbers. And I paraphrase, 'what seems like a few hundred billion in market cap right now, could easily be $20 Trillion by 2020.'

You think it's a coincidence this article came out after the SEC meeting?  

You think it's a coincidence that after those two snippets yesterday I get an email in my box today saying Coinbase is now accepting direct and immediate purchases with my bank account? This, on top of credit cards announcing you can't buy crypto anymore on their credit?

Now they step in, and scoop up all the profits you lost, which gives them the power they didn't have. And why? Because wall street sharks sharpen their teeth on rookies. That's why.

Will the market drop again? Yep. Might it crash? If BTC crashed every year in January for the last 4 years, I'm going to say yes. 

However, will it be because the underlying technology is so weak and bad that the cryptoassets linked to these blockchains are valueless? Nope. 

It will be because suckers are born every minute. And weak hands lose to experience every time. Now stop giving them the freebies.

And don't use this as trading advice. It isn't. Plan. Strategize. Play smart. Their patterns are unbelievably obvious if you stop screaming ""lambo"" and dive into the work of research... your OWN research... not some journalist who may or may not be taking an extra $500 to write a well-placed, slanted article meant to instill a FUD nugget.

Yep.... you little freakin' FUD nugget. You got Played. Schooled. Housed. Owned.

Rage against the machine. That's partly what decentralization is all about. 

I'm done.

This is not a bubble. This was not a crash. This is just the beginning.,1356,7v2has,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7v2has/this_is_not_a_bubble_this_was_not_a_crash_this_is/,547,1517724452.0,"Mainstream financial media's attempt to compare the January 2018 cryptocurrency correction to the 1999/2000 dot-com burst shows their naivety when it comes to Bitcoin and the entire crypto market.  

1. Cryptocurrency has only just begun to enter mainstream awareness never mind adoption.  By the year 2000 when the dot-com burst was in full effect, over 43% of the United States population was using the Internet.   In contrast, after roughly eight years Bitcoin is at best in its early adopters phase.  It is estimated that only .046% of the target population of crypto users has adopted this technology.  We are not at the peak of this cycle as mainstream media would like to suggest, rather we are just starting up the bitcoin adoption  lifecycle.  

2. The Internet was a collaboration of universities and government institutions.  These institutions were well funded.  Once the potential of the Internet began to be understood mass amount of investment from government, education, and private institutions followed.  In stark contrast, there has been little to no investment by any of these entities in cryptocurrency.  In great part Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has been supported by small individual investors who support the technology and/or want to make money.  The day will come when mainstream investors and possibly even governments will make a big move into cryptocurrency.  When this happens the market will explode higher.

3. Almost every government around the world has put roadblocks in front of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency development.  This too is in stark contrast to the Internet where almost every government assisted their people and businesses gain Internet access.  Bitcoin has had threats made against its existence since day one and countless times thereafter. The Internet never faced such a constant threat. In fact I believe it is a testament to the power of Bitcoin for having survived. 

4. Bitcoin threatens banks and the entire financial system for that matter.  The Internet promised ever greater profits for the banks through huge cost savings and investments.  Bitcoin survived a direct assault from one of the greatest bankers in history, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan - Bitcoin survived and Dimon backtracked.  Think of the potential investment when banks and other financial institutions begin adopting blockchain technology - and this is already beginning.

5. The first ICO occurred in 2017.  The ICO is an entirely new use for cryptocurrency.  To say something that has not even been around for a year is in a bubble is difficult to understand.  By the time the dot-com bubble burst in 1999/2000 almost all of the foundation technologies of the Internet had been established.  Crypto wallets and payment systems are just beginning to become available to mainstream users and businesses around the world.   

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is in its infancy, maybe its early adopter phase.  If Bitcoin was being used by any significant percentage of the population I would entertain this notion of a bubble crashing.  We are just starting up the very long and steep lifecycle curve.   And to prove this, even after this terrible correction, year over year, Bitcoin is still up several hundred percent.  

The comparison between the dot-com bubble bursting and the January 2018 correction is untrue and distorts history.  We have not even begun to reach bubble phase.  I am holding my crypto.  I’ll begin selling when my niece asks me if I have any Tron so she can buy a puppy.

This is just the beginning.

The fraud continues - Craig Wright just purposely submitted a provably fake email into evidence in the Kleiman-Wright case,1339,bdxkrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/bdxkrf/the_fraud_continues_craig_wright_just_purposely/,272,1555469155.0,"Craig Wright's fraud continues. Yesterday, he [submitted into evidence](https://www.scribd.com/document/406503654/Fake-email-from-Dave-to-Uyen) an email he says was from Dave Kleiman to Uyen Nguyen asking her to be a director of his 'bitcoin company' in **late 2012**. 

It is provably fake.

**Craig didn't realize that the email's PGP signature includes a signing timestamp along with the ID of the key used as metadata.** Was the email actually sent **in 2012**? Let's find out!

The beginning of the signature is as follows: iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJTH+uQAAoJELiFsXrEW+0bCacH/3K

Converted to hex, it's: 89 01 1c 04 01 01 02 00 06 05 02 *53 1f eb 90* 00 0a 09 10 **b8 85 b1 7a c4 5b ed 1b** 09 a7 07 ff 72

We [know](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880) how to find the long ID of the key used and the timestamp of the signature. I've bolded the ID and italicized the timestamp. Looking on the MIT keyserver, we can [find the fake* key](https://i.imgur.com/5ooGihN.png). **The timestamp of the signature is 1394600848, which is March 12, 2014, two weeks before Craig filed to install Uyen as a director of Dave's old company, and almost a year after Dave died!**

We can double-check with `gpg -vv`. Transcribe the email and paste it in. Here's the output:


    :signature packet: algo 1, keyid B885B17AC45BED1B
	version 4, created 1394600848, md5len 0, sigclass 0x01
	digest algo 2, begin of digest 09 a7
	hashed subpkt 2 len 4 (sig created 2014-03-12)
	subpkt 16 len 8 (issuer key ID B885B17AC45BED1B)

(I'll note, as an aside, that Dave apparently spelled his name incorrectly and put a typo in the subject.)

This was immediately shot down by Raiblocks staff, who said that:

**However, I have reason to believe this is just a cover up, and that a partnership is on the horizons. Here's why:**

I did a search on Censys for raiblocks.net:
https://censys.io/ipv4?q=raiblocks.net

It bought back a result for 'Nano Wallet'. It returned an IP address with a mirrored version of the current RaiWallet with updated branding. Here are the screenshots I got:

It has since been taken down, but there is a support email for support@nanowallet.io visible in my third screenshot.

**Therefore, Raiblocks will rebrand to Nano in the coming weeks. This is incredible news, as I feel DADI will be one of the biggest players in 2018**

Additional proof, the CTO of Dadi had a repo in Github called raiblocks:

I began investing in crypto in October 2017 when some co-workers of mine started getting into crypto. I didn't invest too much at first, but I almost made 10,000 dollars from XRP within two months, decided to ramp up my investments, then almost made another combined 10,000 from other coins. Well, I say ""almost"" because I never cashed out of course. I felt like things were only getting started in December 2017 and that my gains would skyrocket in 2018. I was getting more greedy and my mind ran wild with the financial possibilities of crypto. Days at work would be spent researching crypto and daydreaming about retiring before I'm 30. I felt like a Cryptodamus and that every crypto I invested in would produce crazy gains. I would always read ""don't invest more than you can afford to lose,"" but would idiotically dismiss it just because I made lucky gains on some shitcoins.

At first I would make Coinbase purchases with credit cards, then I moved on to taking out loans after Visa started considering credit card crypto purchases as cash advances. My dumbass figured ""hey, I'll just use credit cards for everyday purchases and take out loans so I have money to invest in crypto now."" Within the span of about 8 months I took out three loans totaling about 15,000 dollars. I treated crypto like a glorified casino and would constantly ""buy the dip,"" telling myself it's just a really short bear market and the next bull run is just around the corner. What do I have to show for my crypto investments? A portfolio that's 77% down. I still buy crypto every now and then, but it's only a very little in order to DCA some of my investments. I should've been smarter and put just a little into crypto from each paycheck. The moment you start putting in more than you can afford to lose is the moment you need to step back and reevaluate your life.

My reckless gambling has put me in a hole where I can barely stay financially afloat. Oh, did I mention I emptied out my savings back in 2018 to buy crypto? Yes, that was another blunder I strongly suggest no one else does. I managed to build my savings a bit back up, so now I'm almost 2 missed paychecks away from financial ruin instead of 1. My friends, family, and girlfriend have no idea how financially fucked I am right now.

At this point I just want to cash out to pay back my loans and credit cards, but I'm at a point where cashing out wouldn't be enough money to pay them back, so it's not worth it. I figure I'll just weather the storm until a bull market returns. If it doesn't, I'll be picking up the pieces of this gamble for years. Good thing I'm only in my mid-20's I guess. Just don't do what I did. It's not fun having financial burdens (that you yourself created) looming over your head every day.

TLDR: Recklessly gambled like a dumbass. Got rekt. Also, have a game plan for taking out profits.",2019-01-18 12:23:16

If you observe early in life that that there are relatively equal forces at all times trying to make money both on the long and the short side of any asset class, it will give you more opportunity to find long-term success.  It's my opinion that without losing your ass once or twice, you can't possibly become a great long-term investor.  

Take heart in the potential that is being created in you.  If you keep the memory of this and use it to grow, you'll have an advantage going forward, be better attuned to risk and speculative market behavior, and you'll give yourself more opportunity to generate higher long-term returns.

I wanted to give it all up in late 2000...but for whatever reason I stuck with it, and it was worth it. If investing has called to you as a career or hobby, that is a great thing.  

Just my 2c.  Good luck out there.  

P.s. I apologize if this sounds pretentious or anything like that.  Definitely not my intention.

Edit:  I really hope the following is helpful, and sorry for the crap formatting.  

**TL;DR** - You all know FOMO/FUD really well, and that can be used in more established markets to make solid returns.  Measuring risk is as important as measuring your potential returns, always compare. People with no investment experience jumping into an asset class/tons of top-down analysis on an asset class usually means its close to a top.  Your experience has value, so don't look at your bank account as the only asset you have...you've all gained experience and that has tons of value, sometimes more than you've lost in money.  More investor activity doesn't always equate to more buying, but more balance/rationality, which for an overheated/risky asset can lead to more selling.  

---


I was asked by u/Cryptomoolah about examples of investment learnings I have gathered over the years, so here goes…

+ You guys have experienced some crazy FOMO/FUD levels, so watch for that in more established industries.  People still sometimes work themselves into a frenzy over really big markets…oil/gas, financials, pharma, retail…guess what?  These are gigantic markets with insanely huge infrastructure underneath them, and they end up weathering BS market sentiment over time much better than people realize, but when FUD hits these guys, look the opposite way.  This worked for me well during the recession…NFW all those giant companies were going out of business, and I got some great basis in some very established names.  Works same for FOMO …people think we are going to run out of oil, and price of oil goes to $150 and oil stocks skyrocket?  We aren’t running out of oil anytime soon, so good idea to reduce your position.  Watch for frenzied thinking…you’ve all just graduated with a college degree in FOMO/FUD.  
+ Every investment comes with an implied risk measure associated with it.  I think about this absolutely every day, every time I choose to deploy capital.  You think something can go up 10x?  Well, if there is an equal chance it can be down 90%, then (simplistically) you are looking at a 0% risk-adjusted return…and I’d look at other opportunities.  There is no such thing as a financial return that didn’t have risk associated.  **Being a good investor means accurately assessing the risk associated with an investment, and measuring your potential return relative to that**.  There are complicated formulas around risk measures, but I personally like to think about it simply relative to volatility.  It’s just a proxy, but it works…i.e. what is the maximum this asset could fluctuate in price before I’d really be surprised?  That gives you a sense of the underlying risk, and therefore how much you need it to “return” to you for it to be worth it.  It’s not perfect, but it can keep you out of trouble.  For example, some people would say that venture investments usually have a 30-50% risk premium associated, so funds typically need to see a path to returns above that measure to have a positive risk-adjusted return
+ One of my go-to’s (which again, isn’t perfect but something I’ve seen happen) is when retail investors start pouring into an asset class, especially with margin, you are closer to a top than you realize.  
+ **Top-down analysis is a killer**.  Hearing how big the market could be and what percentage market share the product will take?  That is empty analysis and it absolutely ravaged investors during the dot-com bubble.  I mean annihilated.  SO many investments based on that flawed thinking.  
+ Business model sustainability can get lost during euphoria.  Can the businesses being invested in ever really turn a profit, and sustain themselves?  What happens when things get more competitive, outside capital dries up, etc?  
+ To my earlier point about symmetric pressures on asset classes, one of my good friends asked for my opinion prior to the CBOE opening options trading for bitcoin.  At the time, I advised him against investing, simply because options entering a “long-only” situation will pretty much 100% going to focus on shorting.  I didn’t do a particularly good job of convincing him though, since he went in anyway.  At the end of the day, more exchanges, more funds, more volume, more investors doesn’t just equate to more buying.  It equates to more **balance**, which as the size of the asset class grows, the pressure for balance increases.  Keep that in mind too with all this ETF stuff…
+ One very successful, smart PM I knew a long time ago said that if an investment you bought is down 20%, sell it regardless of how much you believe in it.  What he meant was you aren’t as intelligent as you think you are, and therefore sometimes mistakes you make are not visible to you right away.  An investment you went into that is down 20%, in his mind, is more likely a mistake than a temporary market glitch.  He’s basically saying you got the risk-adjusted return wrong, so bail.  I admit I have ignored this concept throughout my career, and I have usually been killed for doing so.
+ As far as making you feel better or dealing with being down big, look at it this way:  Everything you have is an asset.  Your money, your relationships, your reputation, your mind, your experience, your word.  So you used to have $60k and now have $20k?  You gained $40k of market experience.  I could see betting long-term on an investor who has $10k after losing 90% of his/her original principal before I would bet on that same investor with $100k without that experience.  Fact is, over the long term having a healthy respect for financial loss/down markets is absolutely necessary for long term success.  Don’t throw that away, but cherish it, nurture it, and weave the experience into your evolving investment philosophy.   
 
Couple other things to watch out for (not necessarily avoid, just increase the risk measure):  

+ Investments where you are only investing in the quality of the “team” (happens in every market, not just crypto) but without a viable business model,
+ Investments where the business is providing a solution where there isn’t a problem,
+ Investments with fundamental structural problems (no leverage over the supplier or customer, investments where revenue growth is driven dis-economically with no path to sustainability)

Again, just my 2c.  My mentor would say you never take 100% of what anyone is saying based on their own experiences, but usually in any person's experience there is always something in there that you can take that is valuable.  I hope I have provided something of value to someone.

Edit 2:
Thanks to everyone for the kind responses!  This is far and away the most engagement I've ever had with a post, and I so appreciate everyone taking the time.  

As a few of you pointed out, I was incorrect with my risk-adjusted return example.  I used an incomplete example that I will often use in venture investing, but stated it incorrectly and I apologize.  The base concept is still valid, I.e. think about downside and incorporate that into your thinking about upside.  But the corrected version would be if your investment has a 10% chance of a 10x and a 90% chance of a zero (a stereotypical VC investment scenario) then it's basically a 0% risk adjusted return.  In reality, and I touched on this in my response to u/Astrocat15 who pointed out the error, the average investor would also have to come to terms with the possibility of being wiped out and whether that was an outcome that could be accepted, which for most people is not...

Personally, if something seems to have a ton of upside, a ton of downside and I can't get my arms around how to value the thing or weigh the scenarios, I lean towards overweighting the downside and will probably look elsewhere .  I might still gamble for fun though...

Thanks everyone, good luck!",2018-08-12 07:03:27

Whether your interest is in the generous compensation, or you're generally excited about the technology, there's a lot to be eager about.

But the roadmap to becoming a developer in this new space is hazy and unclear, even to a lot of seasoned developers. This post aims to put together a mega-list of organized resources to help you begin your journey as a blockchain developer.

**Blockchain Development for Beginners: Getting Started, and Prerequisites**

Before diving in, you should develop a solid understanding of some of the underlying principals, mainly: what is a blockchain, and what can you do with it? 

**What is a Blockchain?**

*A blockchain is basically just a decentralized database or a distributed ledger.*

That's a pretty straightforward answer. Rest assured there is much more complexity under the surface. IBM has taken an interest recently in blockchain development and has put together some great docs that make a good starting point to dive in:

- [Blockchain Basics: Introduction to Distributed Ledgers](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-blockchain-basics-intro-bluemix-trs/index.html)

- [Blockchain Basics: Use Cases](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-blockchain-basics-glossary-bluemix-trs/index.html)


**Making a Blockchain**

Once you feel like you're ready to get your hands dirty, there are a number of articles and posts dedicated to helping you further your knowledge by actually building your own blockchain. Here are a few great articles I'd recommend taking a look through:

- [From “What is Blockchain?” to building a blockchain in less than an hour](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/from-what-is-blockchain-to-building-a-blockchain-within-an-hour-4e738efc819d)

- [Let’s Build the Tiniest Blockchain](https://medium.com/crypto-currently/lets-build-the-tiniest-blockchain-e70965a248b) In Less Than 50 Lines of Python

- [The Birds, the Bees, and the Merkle Trees Ep[0]](https://medium.com/mimir-blockchain/the-birds-the-bees-and-the-merkle-trees-ep-0-blockchains-from-scratch-3cedb1e669eb): Blockchains From Scratch

**Additional Tutorials, Courses & Videos**

- [Programming Blockchain](http://programmingblockchain.com/)

- [11 Best Ethereum Development Tools](https://hackernoon.com/11-best-ethereum-development-tools-to-grow-your-stack-e782fd7156ab)

**Ethereum, Smart Contracts and Apps**

The development of virtual machines like Ethereum has opened the gates for developers, creating an accessible way for you or me to build our own smart contracts / decentralized applications.

[Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) - a programming language used to develop smart contracts and decentralized applications to run in the ethereum universe. Syntactically, it's similar to javascript.

Bitcoin is too risky... Wells Fargo says it also just admitted to stealing/scamming its own customers for 15 years!,1280,aawkfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/aawkfr/bitcoin_is_too_risky_wells_fargo_says_it_also/,215,1546211283.0,"Wells Fargo has been stealing from its customers for years! Surprise Surprise...NOT

Most banks have been stealing from customers and the data is intense, the fines alone near the total market cap for cryptocurrency. If those are the fines guess how much actual money left to never be replaced again.... Pretty sad if you would ask me.

&#x200B;

We all know these banking institutions do not give a crap about us they will do whats best for their own needs and when they get caught they pay a small portion compared to what they truly captured for themselves. What I find most intriguing is that the public hear about it and then life moves on. 

&#x200B;

To me this is why we need Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. We need it to keep things transparent and stop the big bankers from ruining innocent peoples lives for their own gain. All I want to do is educate the masses so they see the truth not what the media is showing!

&#x200B;

What do you all think we should do?  Will bitcoin be the solution to the problems we currently face?

Lets get a discussion about this going because I think there is a lot that we can explore via intellectual conversation about this topic!

"Bitcoin may NEVER return to previous heights, and a lot of you are worrying me.",1277,7vipn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7vipn5/bitcoin_may_never_return_to_previous_heights_and/,659,1517899466.0,"I see a lot of people excited about cryptocurrency buying into these low prices. This is a generally good strategy, but I would posit this is not a good strategy for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an asset we really don't understand. Further, it's not the only asset of its kind, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, there are FAR better alternatives already in existence.

Trying to dollar cost average on Bitcoin could very well end up with you not only trying to catch a falling knife, but repeatedly stabbing yourself in the foot with it while several of us around you happened to put our money in newer technology. 

All I'm trying to say with this post is this:

This could very well be the beginning of a major move away from ""silly"" money (pouring billions into Bitcoin, something that is worth what it is ONLY because it was the first, and for literally no other reason), and very much so a move towards investing in projects with better technology. If this is the case, which I suspect it could be, those of you deciding to hold onto Bitcoin could have an extremely unpleasant outcome.

Edit: People calling me an idiot, asking if I'm being sarcastic. I'm truly not. If you haven't looked into the many interesting projects happening in this area as we speak, I suggest you do so. If you think that Bitcoin adds a value proposition that none of the other ""coins"" can offer, please enlighten me.

Edit2: I'm a computer science guy who enjoys graph theory and cryptography; I actually read the whitepapers most of you gloss over. I'm not saying this as a ""Bitcoin hater"", but rather as a technology and theory enthusiast within the space.

Edit3: BILLIONS of dollars are being sucked out of the market as we speak. The market cap is currently only at 300 billion dollars. It was over 800 billion at one point. The cryptocurrency space is vastly different than it was one year ago. When this money re-enters the market, it may not be in a similar manner as of last time.

Edit4: Market cap is not a 1-to-1 pairing with actual invested fiat. Market cap = price of coin * shares in existence. I should have clarified further, that not only is the market cap rapidly dropping, but if you look at the past few days, billions of dollars are being removed from the market as we speak.

Edit5: I've had to comment in response to many mentions of the price correlation issue. I would expect that the introduction of more fiat/crypto pairs will lead to a reduction in price correlation to Bitcoin. Most alternatives are only available through non-standard means, and so one must go through bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, or bitcoin cash (Coinbase availabilities) to get coins offered on binance or other crypto only exchanges. This is one of my biggest concerns in cryptocurrency at the moment.",2018-02-06 14:44:26

Thanks to Jahendrix for revising into more legal wording. Can't thank this reddit user enough. I love the internet. 

Jahendrix version: 

This petition, which is digitally signed by lawful residents and citizens of the United States who currently invest in or may invest in digital currency (""cryptocurrency"") is directed towards the United States Internal Revenue Service and the United States Treasury. The purpose of this petition is to express concern regarding the potential taxation of the cryptocurrency market as laws and regulations in this area develop. Considering the fast-paced and fluid nature of cryptocurrency price changes and trading, both investors and regulatory agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service have an interest in simplifying the taxation of cryptocurrency. Therefore, we would like to propose that only the exchange from cryptocurrency to cash or cash receivables be considered a realization event for federal tax purposes, not taxed in-between cryptocurrency trades, and a tax exemption for transactions under $600, as proposed in, ""Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act Of 2017"", introduced by Rep. Jared Polis(D-Co), and Rep. David Schweikert (R-Az). These proposals will allow the Internal Revenue Service to more easily regulate the trading and taxation of cryptocurrency, and would allow taxpayers to simplify the means by which they report gains and losses from investing and trading activities. An additional concern for most taxpayers in this area is ensuring that any statutory or regulatory law implemented be made clear, simple and streamlined to minimize the likelihood of taxpayer mistakes in reporting and remitting cryptocurrency-related tax. The following signatures represent lawful residents and citizens who have expressed their consent to this proposal and their desire for the implementation of laws and regulations in accordance with the principles espoused herein.

EOS does not constitute anything close to a blockchain, the txps claimed is not replicable in a real world environment (even as a centralised distributed database system it can not do more than 250txps), there is nothing to stop bp's colluding in bad faith to censor the blockchain, the network comprises of fake users and fake transactions, corruption in the markets associated with EOS is rife from the RAM market right back to the crowd sale where funds were laundered back and forth to make it appear like there was interest aka money laundering, information asymmetry conveniently means that none of the claims regarding computational power being fairly priced and distributed is easily verifiable

From the way the architecture works to the fact that there is no Byzantine fault tolerance and relies on social consensus between crooks to operate to all of the 'critical vulnerabilities being found

We owe it to ourselves as a community to point this out and try to ensure that this cancer and abhorrent community does not spread any further - trade it make money off it by all means (though my preference is not to) just treat with extreme prejudice anyone that is sticking up for this platform

The Market will not recover the way you want it to.,1266,8q7mdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8q7mdy/the_market_will_not_recover_the_way_you_want_it_to/,333,1528730551.0,"Hey guys, long time lurker, first time poster to [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency). 

I've been giving Crypto a lot of thought, and had a good look at myself in the mirror when btc started nosediving from 11k. At that point in time I thought 11k was the bottom, and tried to catch a falling knife. 

Recently, I took a break from looking at the graphs daily, because I realized my mood would always be affected by the giant red bars on my phone. So I deleted my Binance app. Since then I've had time to reflect on Crypto, reflecting on what enthralled me when I first got in. I came to several conclusions. It has completely changed my outlook and re\-adjusted my expectations on crypto\-currencies in general.

Since then, I have cleared away my desire for the green bars, and my misgivings that this is something that would make me the Laurens Bancroft of the 21st century. What came in to replace these thoughts are below, shared with you. 

1) Herd mentality hurts us more than it hurts them. 

I come in contact with 3 kinds of people in my life, and these can be categorized into 3 different groups: People who want to see Crypto succeed, people who don't, and people who don't care about Crypto. 

I was part of the initial group at first, and now I've come to realized that in order for Crypto to succeed, we cannot exclude the people who don't care, and the people who don't want Crypto to succeed. They are an integral part of how Crypto is going to make it in this world, and we cannot ignore them. We cannot be an elitist club of people who think ourselves as a Master\-race that will eventually trump all. 

I came to this conclusion during Chinese new years, at a dinner table with relatives. The conversation slowly swung around what all of us had achieved during the year of 2017, and I had said that I was an avid follower and investor of Cryptocurrency. My relatives were shocked. Some of them tried to dissuade me from investing, others listened with interest with what I had to say. It was then I realized a common denominator among them, it was that they don't understand. 

They don't understand how blockchain can change our world, they don't understand how block\-lattice technology has the potential be the ultimate weapon against corruption, they don't understand how Cryptocurrency can bring humanity to places never ventured before. But they are interested. 

Over the period of the dinner I slowly but surely watered the plant that is now their newfound interest, answering questions to the best of my ability, but at the same time not critiquing their beliefs. I do not talk about the banks, I do not talk about politics, I talked about the wonders of Bitcoin, and the benefits that can be had with it. 

2) Adoption incentives. Unlike many of the inventions that have come to advance humanity, the benefits of Cryptocurrency cannot be felt by myself, or by you. Not in the short term anyway. The effects of Crypto will not be felt in a drastic way, but instead, gradually change events that were normally out of our control. 

We humans adopt things quickly if they are either one of 2 things, they improve our standard of living immediately(e.g getting a car or computer), or provide an immediate incentive(e.g. credit card frequent flyer points). Crypto is neither of them, and that is why it is a long uphill battle to convince someone to take on Crypto, when all it seems to do is add on more trouble for them. 

Being centralized has a thing going for it; few people can make decisions to create incentives for a small loss, in order to exploit an even bigger gain. In Crypto, no one is able to do this, and won't be able to without a centralised figure making decisions for us small guys.

No one seems to have a viable solution to this, which brings me to my 3rd point. 

3) Moon boys. We all want to be on the ride to the next moon, the FOMO is strong, the memes sustain us, and every piece of news directly affects whether we see a red bar or a green bar. Now the feeling is subsiding, and all that is left is pump and dumps that out of our control. 

As a normie that doesn't have the power to control these events, I can only watch as the price gets manipulated. But this is what I signed up for. I believe that I'm not just holding an ordinary piece of money. I'm holding the future. I am holding the blood, the sweat and the tears of thousands that came before and thousands that will come after, because I believe in them, I believe in the idea, and most of all, I want that future, for me and for my descendants that will come after me. This isn't just about me, it's about advancing mankind.   

I believe in a future where Crypto will make the world a fair place for all, a world where corruption and power don't belong to someone we are forced to vote for, that my voice can be heard among the billions. Crypto doesn't align with my monetary objectives anymore, it aligns with me politically. 

This leads to my conclusion. I know that the recent drops have hurt us all, but it's time to look past it. I think it is time to look at what we are holding on to. Is it for the money? Is it the stubbornness? Are we truly here just to take fiat from others at a suitable time? If you manage to find your reason for holding on, I think your resolve be will strengthened.

I look at my Crypto from time to time, and all I see is the hard work of the people who have created something amazing, and I feel honored to be part of this journey. And I will continue investing as much as I can, be it money or time, to further this project. ",2018-06-11 23:22:31

I got the email from: https://www.whois.com/whois/btcgpu.org
**BTG is, without a doubt, a complete scam.**

Looks like they tried running several ICOs from the looks of their domain lists.
Update 2: 
 

Premined: https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/pull/2

* Unfinished pow implementation: https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/pull/15

* Replay protection not implemented (**You might lose your Bitcoins if you try to transfer or sell your 
airdropped Bitcoin gold be careful!**): https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/issues/18

* No change of difficulty algorithm implemented (they will compete with other GPU-mined coin for hashpower)

* No commits merged to main public repo in last 21 days

* Without the difficulty fix alone, this coin will crater rapidly.

Assuming it survives that, without replay protection, big exchanges won't list it, and wallets won't support it.
The code is unfinished and in flux that no-one can seriously review it yet, and there's no commit for a testnet definition yet. (thanks to /u/StrawmanGatlingGun)

Update 1: In their Website-Snapshot from the github (https://github.com/BTCGPU/website) they stated that the fork snapshot already processed: ""Bitcoin Gold (BTG) is a new proof-of-work cryptocurrency that will be hard forked from the Bitcoin blockchain on October 1 at block height 487427"", which actually ended up being September 28th (https://blockchain.info/block-height/487427) partial info thanks to /u/rhuxx for the find.

As some of you may know, Bitcoingold is attempting to fork Bitcoin at the 25th of October. However in the past they decided they'll fork during the **Bitcoincash** date, both of which have ended up confusing me thus I've decided to do more research on the matter.

*As I dug in deeper Bitcoingold started falling apart in front of my eyes losing all my trust in it. Here is what I've found.*

First I read about this to get a better idea behind it: https://medium.com/@EthereumRussian/is-another-hardfork-going-to-kill-bitcoin-bitcoin-gold-e49b24ad8a9

The article mentioned there's been an ICO page, intrigued I decided to do a quick google search and found this 29 August bitcointalk thread that has more information regarding it:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2046790.0

Along with the original Bitcoingold developer thread:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2133536.0

It seems that they have possibly ran an ICO (Unsuccessfully most likely) but most certainly had premined the coin, thus I went to their website which at the time (9th of October) only ran a splash screen: http://btcgpu.org/ in an attempt to confirm my doubts.

This didn't lead me far, I needed to confirm those claims by myself, thus I went to the wayback machine (a wayback machine takes snapshots of websites so you can tell what changed in a website over time) and picked the August 31 date of the bitcoingold website. https://web.archive.org/web/20170831032225/http://btcgpu.org/

**This confirmed the rumors**, the website owners/original developers intended to run an **ICO** (which may or may not been successful) and also **premined** 16000 Blocks, **worth at** **least 200,000 Bitcoin gold**.
The ICO price was supposedly 1 BTC = 10 BTG.

Since they are holding that information away from us and hiding it, this makes me believe that, **bitcoingold is infact a scam** and an attempt to milk the Crypto community out of their money, please don't fall into this scam and don't buy bitcoingold, dump it and let others know you can even do your own research with the Wayback machine I linked above or any time machine.

Regards,
Faycal Kilali

tl;dr BTG (Bitcoin gold is pre-mined 200,000+ BTG, and previously offered as an ICO, now they are trying to hide both of that information from us and telling people to dump their alts to get free ""Bitcoin gold"". the fork dates do not match, they specified different dates 3 times, once in their github page (1th october, and the block ended up being mined at 28th september) and a third time as 25th of october. all this combined information makes this me believe with no doubt that this is a scam in the making, and you should all dump your BTG as soon as you get it and never, ever buy BTG. also there is no replay protection, incomplete pow implementation, and no difficulity adjustment just the replay protection alone means you can lose your BTC by trying to sell/transfer your BTG, whois email associated domains shows complete scammy icos and domains registered under the email, this without a doubt they are 100% scammers.).",2017-10-09 23:29:35

Data dates back from yesterday, but today's confirms this prediction.

**DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. THIS IS JUST ME SHARING MY OWN. Hopefully to kill some of the unnecessary FUD out here.**

I'll go briefly over the following points:

1. How we call this prediction for BTC.

2. Extrapolation to global market cap and other cryptos.

3. What it means for the crypto space.

4. Why this information should help you.

*Note: I'm not a native english speaker so please forgive in advance any approximation in terminology. Hopefully you can correct my words rather than criticize (assume it's logically correct but using the wrong words, before bashing. I'll humbly accept any criticism too, the point is to discuss.)*

# 1. Volumetric Analysis

Observe this chart, especially the horizontal volume bars on the right, relating to pricing: https://i.imgur.com/ePOS4Ag.png

(*Source: Trader of Futures, Published on Jan 29, 2018 on YouTube, link at the bottom. You can watch the video if you want more details about volumetric charts*).

Most people look at Technical Analysis from a price standpoint (candles, etc), but this is more backward-looking than forward. In essence it shows what *has* happened, not what is *about to* happen. 

From a volume standpoint though, you can effectively characterize two very important aspects of a given value:

* horizontally (time axis), you can retrace the actual weight, so to speak, of a move. How much global pressure there is/was in moving (the actual move is based on the average of ups and downs in a given time-frame, but how much volume overall tells you if the market is dull/weak or jacked/strong).

* vertically (price axis), you can effectively characterize the actual levels at which traders are comfortable. When you see a low in volume on the Y-axis, it means that people are avoiding this price point, hence the valuation will usually either stop there (""support"" or ""resistance"" level) or move past it. Which way depends on  fundamentals (internal/external), which we'll discuss in 3. below.

You can see very clearly that BTC is dull right now over January (horizontally), there's not much incentive to upset the current (downward) trend. Down moves are strong, comparatively to consolidations (horizontal/up moves).

You can also identify the following support levels:

* ~$8.44k

* ~$5k

* ~$3k

Notice how the volume is much bigger below 8.4k than it is above: this is strong sign that many people are comfortable buying below 8.4k, indicating that there are little chances we go below (everything will be bought). This is currently the strongest *next* support level for BTC.

Notice also how it's much, much bigger below $5k: reasonably we can assume that BTC cannot move lower. If we break the 5k barrier, it will be bought almost instantly in the $4k-$5k range.

It's all intuition and sentiment, but given the current situation of cryptos (see 3. below), it is **very likely** that we will go down to 8.4k. It is also very likely that we'll pick back up after that.

Currently, there is resistance around $12k. To break above that level, we'd need volume (horizontally, a push up with enough weight). We'll see how it goes once this bear phase becomes bull again. It's hard to know when the shift  back up will happen, but I'd expect in February, and breaking past $12k in March or so.

___

# 2. Extrapolation to global market cap and other cryptos (top 25)

Based on prices from yesterday, a dip to $8.44k for BTC would be about 0.85 its price when I took the values (9913 at the time). 

It seems that the market is vastly correlated to BTC globally, so if we simply assume a linear move for the market globally, here's what we can expect:

https://i.imgur.com/nJb5Uiw.png

In blue, a 0.85 dip. In pink, a 0.51 dip down to $5k-ish.

Again, it's very likely we will hit the blue values. It's possible, although rather unlikely we'll hit the pink ones.

For any value that's not in this chart, just multiply your coin's current value ×0.85 to get a feel of how much lower it will likely go.

For a more thorough price prediction, we should look at volumes (in pricing, Y-axis) of each cryptocurrency. I don't have time to do that, but you can and would therefore identify the proper support levels for each coin. I assumed here that it's overall ""about good enough"" to get a feel.

___

# 3. The crypto space right now

This is the most subjective part of this post so I'll just echo general sentiment.

## Some people have a clear interest for cryptos to go down temporarily

Now that the crypto market has been somewhat legitimized, more and more people want in. They're not willing to buy at ATH obviously, so many are waiting. Others already in are taking profits as they see/saw this bear coming. It's all normal and a factual expectation of any market soaring high, then pausing a bit before going much higher if the underlying fundamentals are good.

The crypto scene right now is a bit of both, good and bad fundamentals (from the tech which is good but mostly beta/alpha, to the use-cases and general legal environment which is uncertain for now and therefore more on the bad sides of things, until such time we clear these unknowns).

Basically, whales are now waiting for the right time to enter. This is our $8.4k support level, as long as there's no major event to upset it (war, stock market crash, basically any macroeconomic bomb).

## The somewhat official Bitcoin (BTC) is currently falling out of favor

Versus other cryptos, BTC dominance over the market went from 66% to 33% in a month. It's a huge loss of dominance that it's very unlikely to recover. Many people are already predicting that Ethereum (ETH) will soon take it over. 

People also realized that BTC was no more viable as a ""peer-to-peer electronic cash system"" (words taken from Satoshi Nakamoto in the white paper) and that many other cryptos could be valid candidate. The space is in tremendous innovation, it's a really before-early-adopter phase right now.

Internally regarding Bitcoin itself, there is also much controversy due to forks over fundamental disagreements (namely Bitcoin Cash BHC) and a questionable new direction taken by self-proclaimed official caretakers of BTC (namely ""Blockstream"").

This is the reason for the feud between r/Bitcoin (BTC) and r/btc (BCH). I won't go into it here, but let's just say that overall it's a bit of shitshow that doesn't reflect good upon any bitcoin fork right now, and that appearances can be very, very deceiving, willingly or not from their respective promoters. Personally, I've been flabbergasted at what I've discovered, and I'm pretty sure it will be a big bomb if it ever reaches the attention of major media (it probably won't though).

Basically, BTC is falling out of favor fast from the general public, and this is causing the general crypto market as a whole to pause, reflect, and probably evolve, but that's never as smooth as it seems.

My personal prediction is that the top 3 coins a year from now may possibly not include any bitcoin(s).

## Tether, Bitgrail, Bitconnect: time to do some cleaning

These are just examples of FUD-inducing events (some would say with good reasons!) that keep nagging this space with pains that keep it volatile and uncertain.

It's not clear at all when the crypto market will become suitable enough for the real mainstream to enter, not even questioning its use cases for now. But there are thresholds in security, trust, compliance that we have yet to pass with flying colors. 

Again, this is causing more uncertainty. Since it's very hard to pinpoint the exact reasons for a surge up or a fall down in value of crypto-values, market actors are taking a stance back before making their bigger moves. Ergo, wait, see what's what.

## South Korea, China and the USA are to make big legal moves

We don't know yet what will the legal situation be 6 months from now. What's sure is that official authorities have taken a big deep look at cryptos now, and Asia is by far the biggest investor especially in the mainstream. We're nowhere near that level in the west, although the importance of the USA in the global economy amplifies its decisions from a media standpoint. 

Europe is also making moves, although as usually these days, it's a bit of an old dwarf versus Asia and America; its rather conservative population is unlikely to make massive moves (a notable exception is Switzerland for its relative independence from the EU).

This is again more general uncertainty, especially in Korea and China, that begs investors to wait a bit before they move. Hence, the bear is making its run. Big money, the kind that has a clear interest for a lower price, isn't doing anything to stop that trend (see first point).

## Big, real, good projects take time

If you look at the development roadmaps and expectations from big projects team members (ETH, NEO...), you'll see that they expect to meet certain very important milestones (notably in scaling) by 2019 or even 2020. We're not there yet for general mainstream VISA-threatening adoption, guys. We still have A LOT of work to do.

Did I already mention that this market needs time?

# 4. What this information all means for you, how does this help?

Obviously the most important parts were 1. and 2. regarding your investments.

You now have a clearer picture of where we're going, most likely. You can anticipate how much your values will drop if they keep going down. So you can now arm yourself with patience, knowing that it is to be expected. 

A bear market sometimes makes casualties, in the form of values (coins, companies, entire sectors...) that had no solid-enough grounds. There are bankruptcies, some teams/projects get bought. Others earn their legitimacy, too.

Don't panic. Just rationalize your investments:

* Are the projects you support solid? It's not about being big (top 25) or small (in the high hundreds on CMC...), it's about being *good*, *realistic*, *solving problems*. It's about having people that can deliver on their objectives (track record, experience, behavior with other actors and on social media). I have more confidence in some rank 1,000-ish cryptos in my portfolio than some top 25.

* How deep are their pockets? Dedicated their team? Can they withstand a month or even year-long bear market? Can they keep the payroll going until there's money coming in, i.e. a valid product? How timely is their product versus the chances of adoption? (this is why I insisted on making part 3. above).

You can't necessarily know the real answer to all these questions unless you're an insider, but some projects are better than others at making these unknowns known. Trust your intuition. If something feels *off* to you, it probably is to some degree. Question is, how comfortable are you supporting them with your own money?

___

# Final words

## Expect the dip to continue. 

Until you see a market cap of ~420 billions, it's just the natural continuation of current volumes. It's OK, you already know (now...) what it means in terms of numbers in your portfolio. You wouldn't be here in the first place if you weren't ready for dips in-between highs.

If we break below that, sub-$400bn, then chances are we'll be heading for a 50%-ish dip, down to ~250bn. It's OK, too. Don't panic sell. Just be brutally honest with yourself before that, to let go of projects that you don't really believe in (moonshots ICOs and over-hyped coins), remain confident as ever in the ones you trust to see the light eventually. 

This is a long term game, we're before early adoption in terms of tech.

There will be many such dips before we get there.

But we'll get there, eventually. That's what we all believe. And we have solid grounds for that belief, it's not faith, it's an educated guess based on how this world and business works.

## If you want to double in (buy more), look at volumes to get a general bearing on your favorites.

Look at volumes on your coins. On the general market. Look how big people are moving, not just how high/low a given value is moving (it could be very low volumes and mean not much, if anything at all).

Don't be the sucker that only looks at candles. Spoiler: good traders don't really care for candles. Price analysis. TA. This is all just a reflection of the past. Volume is where it's at to anticipate moves, and you can only mix that with experience and intuition for the market. That's what investing on markets means. 

You should never invest in something you don't understand, in a company or project you can't judge for yourself. For instance I understand tech, so I'm comfortable investing in Silicon Valley tech companies. But I know shit about retail even though I read Sam Walton's and Jeff Bezos biography. So I don't invest in those. If you invest in crypto, you should at least know a bit about crypto-tech itself, and you should know about the industry your particular projects are targeting. 

None of this post is financial advice (I'm not qualified for that). But this is my only investing advice for you: **know what these guys you're giving money to are doing. Be able to have an opinion about their goals, how it fits in the real world.**

___

That's it, peeps. Already long enough I guess. 

I'm hoping some nice fellow redditor can make a guide to volumetric analysis on tradingview.com or something.

Have a great day.

### EDIT: QUICK UPDATE 2018-02-02 10:44 UTC

* Here's the [current volume profile with up-to-date price curve](https://i.imgur.com/tfwUtX7.png)

We're now standing right above the support level for BTC@$8.4K-ish (Y-axis volume profile). So far this estimation seems to be about right. [disclaimer: it's not just me, several people called this a month ago, I'm actually late to this party.]

* Answering comments about graph analysis of any kind: 

Remember, it's not only graph analysis: a good part of *guesstimating* markets is just that, *guessing*, based on intuition/sentiment/experience, whatever you call it. The news *do* matter, so do the fundamentals (the tech, the target market/sector's readiness for adoption of products (aka S-curve), the legal environment, etc.). Part 3 in this post is mostly why I drew such conclusions from the volume profile, and why I ultimately felt we were going down (and could still go lower). **This doesn't change my general feeling that cryptos are here to stay and will be a major part of the economy in the 2020's.** Nonetheless, volume profile is a strong indicator of future performance, unless major event —extrinsic (e.g. global crash/war etc.) or intrinsic (e.g. bad fork, legal issues, etc.), for a period about as long as the retracing (here, 4 months, so whatever you infer from these charts above could only go as far as April or so). I feel the market is too new and volatile to infer much further from graphs, after that it's only sentiment.

* Back to our chart: 

We broke below the average growth line from early October (white line + ""!"" on this graph). I don't think it's very significant, but some people would, so I included it. Notice we only have 2 strong lows to draw this, one (middle) is weak-ish.

There's a big buy wall underneath our current $8.4K support level, so chances are we'll rebound. If we do break below however, we're headed towards the yellow arrow/line ($5K, $250bn market cap or lower if other cryptos keep falling below BTC, and they very well might *in average* if this is a sanitizing event —which is very much needed for the sanity of this space, imho). Looking at the overall ordered volumes (horizontally), the current fall isn't very much sustained however, about average, indicating a dull movement upset only by previous volume profiles as we speak. An influx of good news could reverse it. Otherwise... brace yourselves.

___

**Edit 2018-02-02 23:30 UTC: the market seems to have stabilized around $410 bn.**
___

**Edit 2018-02-07 13:05 UTC:** We've hit a low of $270~280 bn, BTC tried the $6K level but bounced. News from the USA seems to have a positive effect, possible recovery ongoing (it's an integral part of the way we read these charts today). Volumes are stronger than ever on this rising trend. We may still see a bigger dip or two but general trend imho looks to be upwards.

**We are currently testing a resistance level around $8500 for BTC.** (Next one above is 12K-ish and then there's no foreseeable bound. Below we sit above a direct fall to $5.5K). 

___

**Edit 2018-02-09 01:50 UTC:** We're not in the clear yet, imho. The sentiment is still bearish. There are signs of bulls waiting to come in but we're testing a rather strong resistance level kicking off around $8,400. Below the current $8K price, we do have to confirm or find a floor before we bull back up (last support on Feb 6th was at $6K, history shows a support level around 5,400 (from Nov 12) but volume profile suggests we could test slightly below, $5K support from mid Oct).

I am still observing this market before making another post. I'm about half confident that we're seeing the last bears.

Right now I don't have anything else to say to you other than what I'm personally doing: I'm holding, **not buying this dip just yet**; waiting to see a second confirmation of the support level in the $5K~6.5K range (i.e. support level). I want to make a most educated decision in the aftermath of this crash. I plan to buy in just after the bull market resumes, once I've had several (at least two) possible confirmations (might be RSI, might be volumes, might be some news/sentiment, might be just a textbook 'W' too).

On the way up, regardless of when it happens, we still have to retest several resistance levels: $12.2K, 13K, 14.6K. BTC is very uncomfortable for some reason around $12K, so I expect turmoil in these areas.

Here's my non-professional advice for crucial times: don't be too hasty. Don't panic over 20% when your end game is 200% or ten times that. Don't fear of missing out by a day or even a week when you're in for years... Many (educated) people still believe $30K~40K for BTC by year's end to be a rather conservative estimate. I concur. So who gives a f--k about $2K more or less now? ; )

___

**Edit 2018-02-12 20:20 UTC:** 

This time, the volume profile I outlined 11 days ago was rather spot on. 

I'm still observing the market honestly, we're in a bit of a horizontal move right now. We did stretch almost to $250bn in the dip, but it seems $420bn really is/was the consolidation average box. It's hard to predict which way it's gonna break out in the short term. (for more info, see ""Bitraged"" videos on YouTube, they really nail it in their current videos, lots of educational value too; I really like their channel).

What's sure is that, everyday we spend at this market cap is all the more ground to ""validate"" this $420bn value; in other words as we accumulate historical volume at this level, it means that the crypto market really is worth it (increasingly certainly not less). That's a reassuring sign imho.

I think the real consolidation will happen later this year, probably at a higher market cap, when ""good"" coins/projects start siphoning the ""bad"" ones. Big finance involvement (and their many audits, reports, evaluations, etc. destined to their major customers) will sort out the market hopefully more rationally than it is today. I expect this to slowly be reflected on rankings like CMC.

Regarding Q2-Q3, there are increasingly many more signs that the future looks bright *overall*. However I'm thinking that the involvement of big financial institutions (FI) will likely result in much more regulation and therefore the death of many not-so-fantastic projects/coins, and some exchanges as well. I hope this will truly be the year of decentralized exchanges, so that we have an alternative to big FI's exchanges (I personally would use both, for different purposes).

Personally I'm regrouping my assets around projects I really really trust, those with a promising basis and already established demand (e.g. fiat-to-crypto gates, or crypto management solutions for the mainstream), while planning on investing in some hot-shot ICOs during Q1.

Uncle Sam is a bully and crypto to crypto tax is just BS.

It's so frustrating that some of us have to liquidate a part of our current investment holdings, and thus, lowering our overall future ROI, just so we can pay someone who risked none of his own money his share of the pie. 

I am all for paying taxes. It's only right that we pay for the safety and conveniences that our country have given us, but taxing crypto to crypto transactions is just stealing. Crypto to crypto transactions is not capital gains! We should not treat crypto gains like fiat gains because we simply can't walk into a convenient store and make a purchase with the majority of cryptocurrencies that are currently available on the market. It should still be considered within the realm of a long term investments holdings until we cash out to fiat. It's only fair that we're taxed, only, when we cash out to fiat and into our bank accounts where we can actually spend it . Until then, it shouldn't be taxed at all! 

It's frustrating because some of us have yet have the privilege to enjoy our investments in its fiat form, and here we are selling off some of our holdings, cutting into our future overall ROI, putting our dreams on hold, just so we can pay Uncle Sam his share of our hard earned money on a risk that we, ourselves, took. It's wrong on so many level. The US government should reconsider only taxing cryptocurrency investments after it gets liquidated into it's fiat form and into our bank accounts where it'll be spent as part of our income. Until then, Uncle Sam is just being a bully, and what we're sacrificing to pay this bully is just BS. We're giving you your fair share of the pie, Uncle Sam! All we ask is to be fair to us in return, too, please! 

P.S. I think crypto to crypto transactions should still be considered as a long term investment hold since we're not able to spend it like income.",2018-01-23 02:14:05

I had the majority of my backup keys saved for sites I used Google Authenticator on. For some reason I didn't save a couple because I figured it saved account wide, and they had little to no money/value to me so didn't mind. Well I found out the hard way that it doesn't save account wide. I was able to get back access to my phone by using the oven trick on my mb so that my phone would work for a couple minutes and used the authenticator to log in and shut off f2a on sites I didn't have the backup keys for. Only $160ish eth was at risk here for me. But after talking to other people I've found many people are under the same (stupid) notion I was that the Google Authenticator app saved account wide like many of the google apps do. 

For some sites like coinbase and coss they have no issues turning off your f2a if you provide the correct documentation, but there are some sites out there that won't. Be careful with your money and always have backups. This is why the best solution is still desktop/hardware wallets imo, but even with those you still need to be careful and keep backups of everything.

Sorry for the rant, but if this helps one person I'll be happy. 

TL;DR Google Authenticator and many authenticator apps don't save account wide, if you lose your device or your backup keys you can be SCREWED.


Edit: My original post wasn't clear. To clarify Google does NOT save your third party authentication information on it's cloud it is only saved on the device you took that QR picture of. If your phone is lost this info is lost unless you saved a master key from when you signed up for that third party 2fa. The emergency keys google gives are for google services ONLY.

Let's talk about EOS,1207,7z4s2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7z4s2e/lets_talk_about_eos/,656,1519240078.0,"I've been doing a fair bit of research on EOS. I originally had some difficulty. Due to this, I've come up with alist of pros & cons. I've tried to be as unbiased as possible while writing this. A small percentage (less than 3%) of my holdings are in EOS. 

Just like any coin-focused subreddit /r/EOS is very positive & bullish on EOS, so I found it too biased to DYOR. (as expected, most dedicated coin subreddits are fairly biased)  

First, a bit of background.

Similar to Ethereum, EOS is  a platform for the development of dApps. The goal is to combine the benefits of other platforms together, resulting in an huge opportunities for scaling. EOS wants to lower the barrier of entry for devlopers seeking Blockchain solutions.

**Pros:**

1. Combines Bitcoin's security & the computing support of Ethereum into one stable, efficient platform.

2. EOS has integrated parallel processing. This is really big for future proofing the coin. This is the reason why people think EOS having a speed of 100,000 TPS isn't too far fetched.

3. A use of the token. So many ICO's have no anticipated use for their token. For a developer to deploy an app on the EOS Blockchain, they must hold a number of EOS tokens. This will create a demand for the token, increasing it's value.

4. Like Ethereum's ERC20, EOS allows new tokens to run on the Blockchain.

5. Unlike Ethereum, EOS has no fees. This increases it's adopt-ability potential. Block producers are paid in EOS to produce blocks instead.

6. Adoption by major players is already occurring, BitFinex launching decentralized exchange: EOSFinex, built on the EOS Blockchain. Wikipedia's Co-Founder (Dr. Larry Sanger) is the CIO of Everipedia. A decentralized encyclopaedia based on the EOS Blockchain.  

7. Created by Dan Larrimer, with a a track record of successful projects behind him. Daniel also founded Steemit & Bitshares.

**Cons:**

1. ETH has the first mover advantage in the smart-contract ecosystem. Systems have already been built on top if it. Will be difficult to convince developers to make the switch.

2. The ICO distribution model isn't well thought out, although there are reasons for it, having a year long ICO doesn't inspire trust. (Sidenote, this distribution method slows down whales collection big stacks of EOS, reducing centralization.)

3. Development isn't finished - I expect this point to be moot in the next few months, the team is working hard, although for now there isn't yet a working product, as a result, I believe currently it is undervalued.

What do you think? I'm sure I missed some things, please do correct me if I'm wrong. ",2018-02-22 03:07:58
I took one for the team today..,1209,7qjhih,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7qjhih/i_took_one_for_the_team_today/,314,1516049539.0,"Today I sold most of my alt coins even at a 50% loss. I know some of you will say kucoins coin prices will eventually all go up but nobody knows. 

Unless I sell them.  
Usually when I sell a coin, it skyrockets the next 24hrs. I took one for the team today. I lost some profits but it’s ok. 

And to make things better, I bought NEO at it’s all time high. Usually when I buy a coin, it sinks. So you guys can buy NEO at a cheaper rate. 

I love crypto and I love you guys. 

Ps. I will sell NEO once it dipped hard ok. And you know what happens when I sell. 

Edit: Let’s see what happens in the next 24hours. Hopefully the market improves. Thank me later.

Edit: Some if you guys need to take a chill pill, the market is dipping, it’s not even crashing like what the news say. Chill and have fun 

Edit: Some of you are so serious. What you are doing is only gonna affect your decisions. Don’t emotional trade yo. DYOR and see the gains. Money isn’t everything. 

EDIT: I’M SO SORRY GUYS, I COULDNT HELP MUCH BECAUSE THE WHALES ARE BACK MANIPULATING FOR THEIR FUTURES BET. :(",2018-01-16 04:52:19
